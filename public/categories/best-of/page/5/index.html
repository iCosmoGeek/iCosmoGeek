    <p>Apple is remarkable and popular to its minute design tweaks and improvements in terms of graphics and calligraphy. Today, I noticed a weird text overlap on my iPhone 4S running iOS 5.
Before you watch the video to reproduce on your devices, here is the screenshot of the bug:
If you carefully observe above two screenshots, the ‘Battery Usage’ is overlapped with ‘Manage Storage’ and the iCloud description is also repeated twice in the first screenshot.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Do you ever even wonder how the consistent style of Steve Jobs’ black mock turtleneck uniform emerged? Before he died, Steve himself explained to biographer Walter Isaacson. This official biography is set to release on October 24th.
The author Isaacson sent the real story behind the black turtleneck uniform to Gawker:
On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony’s chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company’s factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. “I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple,” Jobs recalled.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Sure, Facebook is a great tool to use when you are updating your family members, or keeping in touch with your friends. Or, as some students put it, “Facebook Stalk” their friends. It’s great to upload pictures, chat with longtime friends that life faraway, and write on people’s walls. Sometimes, going on Facebook is also a great break. It could be a great break from a long homework assignment, or it can also be a good break from your work. Let’s face it, people can’t work 8 long hours without some sort of break. Going on Facebook is considered an acceptable form of a break. It can break the monotony. However, there are also some things that need to be considered when you go on Facebook.

Even though he officially resigned, Jobs will still be actively involved in Apple’s future.
I could go on and write about Steve’s innovations, revolutions and accomplishments but I recommend to read the official biography which is going to be released in early 2012. This man started Apple in his parent’s garage and after several problems the company now turned into the empire.
