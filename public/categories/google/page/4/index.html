    <p>It’s raining tablets and smart phones everywhere. They all are packed with never heard of features and that too in real small packs. But a major drawback of any tablet or smart phone is its limited storage capacity. Even the top of the class devices cannot carry too many movies or audios. Those with expandable memories are too limited by inadequacy of flash drives.
It seems hard drives would have been a better way out. And Seagate cared to come out with a solution. They released an external hard drive - GoFlex Satellite - capable of streaming data to iPads, Android tablets and even smartphones.

Reader or tablet
Are you looking for just a book reader, or do you want access to magazines and newspapers as well? Do you want a device that allows you to browse the Internet, listen to music, and watch movies, or do you have your laptop for all of that?

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>You must have read this shocking news about Carrier IQ software already. This piece of software logs texts, key taps, calls, emails, strokes, etc. without your knowledge. Here is how to verify and remove Carrier IQ on your Android device.
Trevor Eckhart, the same security researcher who actually discovered Carrier IQ’s fishy activities now posted an .APK with name Logging Checker.

For those who haven’t heard of it, Google TV is a software platform for set-top boxes and HDTVs based on the Android OS.
