  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>We have seen many cases where the two massive corporations – Apple and Samsung – in legal battles. Here is one more thing.
Samsung is now asking the Australian court for the source code of the latest iPhone 4S’ firmware, and also any agreements that have been made with Vodafone, Telstra and Optus prior to the launch in Australia.
According to SmartOffice, Samsung believes that the iPhone infringes on three of its patents that deal with 3G wireless technology and the transmission of mobile data. Apple would need to show all the source code of the iPhone 4S and deals made prior to launch in the future.

    <p>With the release date of official Steve Jobs’ biography fast approaching (Monday, October 24), CBS News managed to pull some interesting quotes from it. According to the report, Jobs felt that Google’s Android OS frayed off a number of features from Apple’s iPhone and iOS.
Interesting passages from the book include Jobs’ anger towards Google and Eric Schmidt after HTC released iPhone like device running Android. Jobs went as far as to consider Google’s actions “grand theft,” and so began the string of lawsuits which have now drawn a very prominent wedge between the two rivals.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Do you ever even wonder how the consistent style of Steve Jobs’ black mock turtleneck uniform emerged? Before he died, Steve himself explained to biographer Walter Isaacson. This official biography is set to release on October 24th.
The author Isaacson sent the real story behind the black turtleneck uniform to Gawker:
On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony’s chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company’s factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. “I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple,” Jobs recalled.
