    <p>Now that everybody are excited about Apple’s new Siri feature, Microsoft have been talking a lot over the past couple of days about the not so popular feature in Windows Phone 7 known as Microsoft Tellme.
The research office from Microsoft told Forbes recently that Microsoft has had similar technology on its Windows Phone platform for more than a year!
According to the interview:
“People are infatuated with Apple announcing it. It’s good marketing, but at least as the technological capability you could argue that Microsoft has had a similar capability in Windows Phones for more than a year, since Windows Phone 7 was introduced.”

    <p>Yesterday, Logitech hosted an Analyst and Investor Day and CEO Guerrino De Luca says that his company’s dance with Google TV was a big mistake and announced that it will stop producing the set top boxes.
It is estimated that Logitech spent about $100 million on the product and has little to show it.
For those who haven’t heard of it, Google TV is a software platform for set-top boxes and HDTVs based on the Android OS. And Logitech developed a separate box Logitech Revue that includes a companion box, which is an external device that connects to your TV though an HDMI port. One of the main advantages or applications with this device is video conferencing using a Logitech HD camera.

Siri was founded in 2007 by Dag Kittlaus (CEO), Adam Cheyer (VP Engineering) and Tom Gruber (CTO/VP Design). Siri was originally developed as an iOS application available in the App Store and later acquired by Apple on April 28, 2010. It is now integrated part of iOS 5 and available only on iPhone 4S (taken from Wikipedia).

Here is the key point from the post -
“Our future work with Flash on mobile devices will be focused on enabling Flash developers to package native apps with Adobe AIR for all the major app stores. We will no longer continue to develop Flash Player in the browser to work with new mobile device configurations (chipset, browser, OS version, etc.) following the upcoming release of Flash Player 11.1 for Android and BlackBerry PlayBook. We will of course continue to provide critical bug fixes and security updates for existing device configurations. We will also allow our source code licensees to continue working on and release their own implementations.”
