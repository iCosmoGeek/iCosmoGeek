    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Have you ever imagined of viewing 3D images on your iPhone 4 without glasses?
Jeremie Francone and Laurence Nigay, two researchers from the Laboratory of Informatics of Grenoble at the EHCI Research Group in France, have created an unbelievable technology for viewing 3D images on iOS devices without glasses.
i3D (Free App) which is developed by the University Joseph Fourier uses Head-Coupled Perspective (HCP) which uses the front camera of the device to track the face of the user in real time. This information tells the app how the user is looking at the display. The app updates the perspective of the 3D scene accordingly, giving the user the illusion that he looks at a small window. The objects on the screen will change their position creating a 3D like effect on a 2D screen.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Since it’s release, Apple has been collecting location data on it’s users of the iPhone. This has been very worrisome to various users and privacy advocate groups. However, for a solid week, Apple has been denying that it tracks users locations at all. Finally, a security researcher released a data file that showed that the iPhone was in fact gathering location data. Apple released a list of 10 questions recently saying that the location data doesn’t store the physical location of iPhone users, but instead keeps a list of cell phone towers and Wifi hot spots around the user. It does this so the phone doesn’t have to listen for faint GPS signals from satellites. The fact that Apple took so long to release this report is a crisis, according to experts, that could have been averted had Apple been upfront about the usage, or lack thereof, of the location data. Immediately upon releasing their phones, they should have released a privacy policy making clear the exact usage of this data.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Apple has finally admitted that the latest “LocationGate” as a bug and it will be fixed in upcoming iOS software update.
According to the latest press release a while ago, Apple is collecting data from iPhones, but it is not tracking the location and has never done so and has no plans to ever do so.
The main part of the press release -
6. People have identified up to a year’s worth of location data being stored on the iPhone. Why does my iPhone need so much data in order to assist it in finding my location today?
This data is not the iPhone’s location data—it is a subset (cache) of the crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone to assist the iPhone in rapidly and accurately calculating location. The reason the iPhone stores so much data is a bug we uncovered and plan to fix shortly (see Software Update section below). We don’t think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days of this data.

This secret file is also copied to owner’s computer when the two are synchronised.
What’s so bad about this?
The most immediate problem is that this data is stored in an easily-readable form on your machine. Any other program you run or user with access to your machine can look through it.

    <p>The smartphone industry is again on patent issues. Nokia, Apple, Microsoft, Motorola - all seems to be currently in litigation.
Have you noticed Samsung’s Galaxy line of products? Does they look an awful lot like iDevices [iPhone, iPod Touch]. Apple think so.
Apple filed a trademark infringement suit against Samsung last Friday with a U.S. District Court in North California. Apple’s court filing is filled with examples of the copycatting, ranging from product design to user interface. The suit mentions Apple patents from 2009 and 2010 that explain the iPhone’s physical design and various app icon trademarks.
