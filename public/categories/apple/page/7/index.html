    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>If you have an iPhone or an Android device, you’ve got apps. Games, organizers, calendars and various trackers can be found on virtually any mobile device. But do you have apps for your car? There are tons of apps for drivers; some are free and some will cost you but they are all useful.
Here are our favorites:
G-Park
While it can be difficult to lose your car in the parking lot of an amusement park with their lot markers and landmarks, it is incredibly easy to misplace your car at the mall. If you frequently find yourself wandering through parking lot aisles searching fruitlessly for your car, this app is for you. When you exit your car, hit the ‘Park’ button and when you’re ready to find it, hit the ‘Where did I park?’ button. The app will guide you to your parking spot. Handy!

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So you finally gave in – you finally decided that it’s time to invest in an e-book reader. But which one? Apple’s iPad? Amazon’s Kindle? Noble’s Nook? Choosing an e-reader may seem like an overwhelming task, but with the right information and the awareness of your particular needs, the choice should be a simpler one than you may think.
Reader or tablet
Are you looking for just a book reader, or do you want access to magazines and newspapers as well? Do you want a device that allows you to browse the Internet, listen to music, and watch movies, or do you have your laptop for all of that?

    <p>When Steve Jobs claimed that Google “stole” Apple’s innovation, today, the United States Trade Commission (ITC) agreed and all those HTC infringing products are banned from the US. This rule applies to several popular HTC products including Evo 4G, Droid Incredible, G2, etc. The rule applies to all Android HTC devices running 1.6 to 2.2 in the United States effective April 2012.

    <p>Since Apple’s iPhone 4S launch, everyone has been talking about one awesome feature: Siri. This feature was the first of its real kind of piece of software using normal talking language.

Even though Siri is technically still in beta, it impressed us in many other ways. Now, everybody started copying it. First in the line is Google. Read on..

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Microsoft is doing decently good with their recently launched Windows Phone 7.5 platform. I had a chance to test some of its exciting features on Samsung Focus i917.
Just like Apple’s iOS App Store alternative for jailbreakers – Cydia, Windows Phone 7 users get an alternative apps distribution platform to Windows Market Place, known as Bazaar.
These alternative platforms let in apps that are rejected from the official App Store or Market Place. Just like Apple’s App Store, Microsoft’s Market Place is a well monitored and closed system unlike Google’s Android market. All apps that are submitted that are submitted for App Store or Market Place goes through a strict screening process. If an app is found to be violated guidelines set by Apple or Microsoft, it is rejected and sent back to the developer.

    <p>The latest buzz about Carrier IQ is all around tech and non-tech world. Yesterday, we learned how to verify and remove Carrier IQ from your Android device. But, that method requires you to root your device.
Now, we learn how to detect about this spying software, but not yet remove, and no rooting of your Android device is required.
While this Carrier IQ crap develops, battle between OS developers and mobile carriers continues, a free app Voodoo Carrier IQ Detector lets you verify whether your Android device is infected or not. Unfortunately, it only verifies but do not remove. After installing, once you launch this app, if you see the detection score as 0 which means best, and anything above zero means Carrier IQ is present and you should seriously consider rooting your Android phone.

It records everything you do from your phone. It can even grab your passwords and queries! Worse!
The below embedded video recorded by Trevor shows how it works. The spying software called Carrier IQ (developed by www.carrieriq.com) secretly logs everything a user does with his phone including text messages, encrypted web searches, phone calls, location and you name as well!
