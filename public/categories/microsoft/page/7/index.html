    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>IT World’s Sando Villinger has some interesting findings in Microsoft’s next generation operating system – Windows 8. One of the known or unknown hidden features that various people have discovered since internal builds began leaking over couple of months is the new file system – Protogon.
Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 features in a press release.
From the IT World article,
I’ve also dug up traces of some underlying file system changes that I couldn’t quite make sense of, such as an entirely new file system driver called “NT Protogon FS driver”, which looks like a kernel mode driver for some sort of (yet unknown) file system called Protogon. It’s unclear, whether this is a major new file system or just some minor subsystem

Here is the original version of that video taken from YouTube -
Surprised? Now, this original video was remixed with fabulous lyrics. Listen now!
This is a must hear for every developer and check out the lyrics -
I’m a developer
in many senses of the word
cause I make these applications
but I also use these verbs
to make this music
I construct it line by line
just like when I’m coding
another software design
in both cases
its about design patterns
anyone can get the job done
its the execution that matters
I have many interests
sometimes they conflict
my creativity can usually be a benefit
but sometimes it keeps me
far too busy
but I can’t complain
because my life is hardly gritty
so I think i’ll sit back
and pen myself another ditty
why is it that Linus Torvalds
the only one that Gits me
did you get that reference I was using
or is the thought of source source control too confusing
may just lay myself down a Team Foundation
so I can test the objects of my creation
