<title>Apple: Location Tracking Is A Bug and It Will be Fixed | iCosmoGeek</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="Apple has finally admitted that the latest “LocationGate” as a bug and it will be fixed in upcoming iOS software update.
According to the latest press release a while ago, Apple is collecting data from iPhones, but it is not tracking the location and has never done so and has no plans to ever do so.

The main part of the press release -

6. People have identified up to a year’s worth of location data being stored on the iPhone. Why does my iPhone need so much data in order to assist it in finding my location today?
This data is not the iPhone’s location data—it is a subset (cache) of the crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone to assist the iPhone in rapidly and accurately calculating location. The reason the iPhone stores so much data is a bug we uncovered and plan to fix shortly (see Software Update section below). We don’t think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days of this data.">
