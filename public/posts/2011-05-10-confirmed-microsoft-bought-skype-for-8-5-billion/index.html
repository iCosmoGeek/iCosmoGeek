<title>Confirmed! Microsoft Bought Skype for $8.5 Billion | iCosmoGeek</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="Its confirmed now! After Wall Street Journal’s report, All Things Digital has now confirmed that Microsoft just bought Skype for a huge amount of $8.5 billion.
This deal to buy Internet telephone company Skype is officially going to be announced early tomorrow morning.

Early reports indicated that Facebook and Google were also looking to acquire the telephony giant, but it was Microsoft with its highly aggressive bid which got them.
To don’t know what is Skype, it allows users to make voice calls and chats over the Internet. Calls to other users within the Skype service are free, while calls to both traditional landline telephones and mobile phones can be made for a fee using a debit-based user account system. Skype has 663 million registered users as of 2010.">
