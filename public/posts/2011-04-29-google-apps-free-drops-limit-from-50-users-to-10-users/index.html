Here is the update received from Google Apps Team to its customers -\nHello,\nWe recently announced upcoming changes to the maximum number of users for Google Apps. We want to let you know that, as a current customer, the changes will not affect you.\nAs of May 10, any organisation that signs up for a new account will be required to use the paid Google Apps for Business product in order to create more than 10 users. We honor our commitment to all existing customers and will allow you to add more than 10 users to your account for ***** at no additional charge, based on the limit in place when you joined us.\nSincerely,\nThe Google Apps Team\nReducing the limit to 10 users for the free version is actually a bad news compared to 50 users to this point. On the other hand, the good news is that there is also a new Flexible Plan with monthly billing and no contractual obligations.\nFrom the blog post -\nFirst, for customers who sign up online we’re adding the Flexible Plan, a new $5 per user per month pricing option which requires no contractual commitment – one of the most flexible plans in the industry today. With this plan, businesses can add or remove users as necessary and will automatically be billed for the proper amount. We’ll continue to offer the current pricing option – $50 per user per year with a one-year commitment – as the Annual Plan.\nSchools and non-profits that qualify for Google Apps For Education will not be affected with these new policies.\n",

<p>Reducing the limit to 10 users for the free version is actually a bad news compared to 50 users to this point. On the other hand, the good news is that there is also a new Flexible Plan with monthly billing and no contractual obligations.</p>
