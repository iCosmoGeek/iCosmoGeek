Titled &ldquo;Designed By Apple – Intention,&rdquo; the video displays words set against simple design patterns and its definitely worth a watch!

The simple words in the video (at the end of the post) appears to be a message to consumers of the company&rsquo;s product quality and more of direct answer to media, tech industry and everyone. The company just answered its competitors like Samsung who make more phones and throw in every feature they can think of to innovate them. Apple doesn&rsquo;t work in that way and won&rsquo;t rush things to market.">
