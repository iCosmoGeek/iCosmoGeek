    <p>Apple recently announced the next iOS version, iOS 5 which includes amazing new features – notification centre, improved home screen, and much more.
Even though this is in beta, there is a weird bug where the OS crashes on the whole when the music app is launched with earphones or headphones plugged in. I am not sure this is only specific to 3rd generation iPod touches but the bug is still present in iOS 5 beta 2 (it is even present in Beta 1) which is released on July 24, 2011.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Shopping Online: Your Guide to Buying a Laptop
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
Buying a new laptop is often confusing for many of us if we’re not tech savvy enough to understand all the jargon or just plain don’t know the requirements we are looking for. With that in mind we’ve put together a brief guide to choosing yourself a laptop which should make it easier for you to end up with the right model for you.
Defining your usage
This is the most important step in buying a laptop as many people buy laptops that either exceed or do not meet their requirements. Buying a poor quality laptop will end up costing you more in the long run and buying too high a quality laptop is simply a waste of money. So you need to determine your usage. If you mainly use your laptop for work, email etc then you can get by with a very low end computer as you don’t require a lot of memory or performance based hardware. If you want a laptop for digital design or gaming then you will need a much higher performance, a good graphics card and a lot of memory. If you use your computer as your primary media device then you will also want a good quality sound card and a high quality screen. If you determine your usage in this way you should be able to have a much better idea of what you need.
Secondly you need to determine how mobile you want your laptop to be. If you intend to travel with it extensively for work or require something with a long battery life for extended trips away then you need to analyse these requirements. Generally this information will be clear but always minus a few hours from the battery life as this tends to be a best case figure. Sacrificing size for battery life or vice versa is worth considering depending on your needs.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Soon after approving .XXX top-level domains for adult websites earlier this year, ICANN today has approved a plan to usher in one of the biggest changes over the Internet’s Doman Name System. The new program will significantly allow companies, organizations and cities to register their own brands.
You can soon think of .FACEBOOK, .TWITTER, .HOTEL, .APPLE and even .ANYTHINGYOULIKE !!
According to the official message, the board vote was 13 approving, 1 opposed, and 2 abstaining. The Board approved a plan to dramatically increase the number of Internet domain name endings – called generic top-level domains (gTLDs) – from the current 22, which includes such familiar domains as .com, .org and .net. Applications for new gTLDs will be accepted from 12 January 2012 to 12 April 2012.
