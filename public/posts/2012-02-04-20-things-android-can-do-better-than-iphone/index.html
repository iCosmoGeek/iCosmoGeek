Other cell phone manufacturers cowered, whispering amongst themselves. No single phone blew its horn in challenge. And then came Android.\nAnd today we are actually talking about 20 things that Android can do better than iPhones!\n1. Android Supports Multiple Hardware Options About 10 brands of smartphones use Android OS at the moment, and the list is growing. iOS, on the other hand, is used only by iPhones and other Apple devices.\n2. Android Runs Multiple Apps Simultaneously IPhone’s application multi-tasking is limited to email, iPod and Phone apps in the background. Android phones can run both system and Android marketplace apps at the same time. GPS data recording and app notifications continue to run even when the apps are closed.\n3. Android Makes Us Life Easier Through Widgets On Android phones, you can launch applications, to call specific numbers, to update your Twitter status, and also enable actions for different contacts with a single click using widgets.\n4. Android Batteries Can Be Charged You’ll have to take your one-piece iPhone batteries for charging to an Apple service center, but with Android, you can easily remove and charge the batteries on your own.\n5. Android Allows Wireless App Installation Users can view their existing phone apps through the web, and install apps they want wireless from the web market. The Apple store only allows users to browse and buy apps, not install them.\n6. Android Users Can Flash New ROMs Custom versions of Android’s internal memory firmware are available, such as Cyanogen 6, which allow users to add, quicken and customize functions they need.\n7. Android Allows Task Automation The Tasker app sets Android to activate Wi-Fi, adjust screen brightness, and turn off data connection or GPS as required, while JuiceDefender saves battery. There are many such apps which automate tasks.\n8. Android Provides Flash Support Android supports Flash, which means you can view content from Flash-based sites. iPhone users draw a blank when it comes to Flash.\n9. Android Phones Offer Better Navigation The Back button and the Menu button right next to the Home button make page navigation simple. In an iPhone, you have to get into Settings to access even the Back button.\n10. Android Users Have Multiple Keyboard Options Android provides multiple keyboard options such as the innovative Swype keyboard, the adventurous 8pen, keyboard and the text predictor Swiftkey. Keyboards are separate applications on the iPhone, and users have to import text to a different program.\n11. Android Allows Home Screen Customization You can add extra features to your home screen such as gestures and shortcuts using third-party custom home launchers. Only experienced iPhone users manage to achieve home screen customization.\n12. Android Phones Can Be PC-Controlled You can access your phone’s functions through a browser or send text messages from Chrome. You can connect to your iPhone through Virtual Network Connection, but it’s not the same.\n13. Google Application Integration Android is from Google and therefore all Google apps such as Google Voice, Google Maps will be easily integrated. Google Voice is available on the iPhone as well, but the experience is not smoothly integrated, as is the case with Android phones.\n14. Android Phones Support Multiple Browsers iPhone uses only the Safari browser, which is fast and reliable but not noted for flexibility or Flash support. Even if you wanted to, you cannot install a different browser on your iPhone, which limits your experience. On Android phones you can use the Android browser, Opera Mini, Dolphin and several others.\n15. Easy Connectivity Options You can turn on and turn off your Wi-Fi, BlueTooth, GPS or Mobile Network right from your desktop in Android phones. You don’t have the same flexibility in an iPhone, where you have to dig through the Settings menu for everything.\n16. Single Notification Bar For Multiple Notifications On Android phones, all applications send their notifications to the notification bar. You can view your email, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and other notifications in one place, instead of looking through individual apps, as is the case with iPhones.\n17. Limitless Personalization Options You can configure your Android phone with individual screens for social networks, communications, photos, contacts, email, RSS and much more. iPhones are limited in this area.\n18. Android Is An Open Source Technology Android’s open technology allows developers worldwide to add their skills to the Android developer community. This means thousands of innovative free apps, frequent testing for weaknesses, frequent updates to OS and firmware to better Android.\n19. Android Supports Multiple Carriers iPhone works only with AT\u0026T in the US while Android supports multiple carriers; you won’t be locked down to any one carrier.\n20. Android Allows For External Storage iPhones have fabulous storage capacity, but storage gets used up soon. Android provides both internal storage and slots for microSD cards.\nAbout the author: Dean writes for conversion optimization services Company Invesp that offers large range of services like landing page optimization, conversion rate audit, landing page templates designing and lot more.\nAbove mentioned points are author’s own views. This blog owner is one of those special Apple fan boyz and personally prefer Apple’s iOS over Android for its unique security, App Store, easy of use, access, innovative features.\n[Image]\n",
