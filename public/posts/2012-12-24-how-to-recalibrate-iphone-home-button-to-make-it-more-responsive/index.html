<meta name="description" content="The iPhone is a great device. It is a always a winner due to its build quality and reliability. But sometimes, the Home button on the iPhone can just behave a little funky, a little laggy, a bit unresponsive. I have experienced this issue on my iPhone 4S couple of times and I am sure it is an issue in other models as well.
Most of the times, these issues are caused by software, unless you&rsquo;ve dropped your iPhone in water!
