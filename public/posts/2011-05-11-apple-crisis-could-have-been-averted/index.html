Immediately upon releasing their phones, they should have released a privacy policy making clear the exact usage of this data.\nApple also said in their statement that there is a software bug that stores the data the iPhones collect for up to a year, but this bug will be fixed on the next release to reduce the amount of time the data is stored. Instead of denying that the data file existed, Apple should have answered their customers’ concerns, even if they weren’t sure about all the details yet. Apple saying “I don’t know, but will update you soon” would have been better than lying to their savagely loyal customer base.\nWhen asked why Apple chose to wait so long before they responded to the concerns, they had no comment. However, speaking to the New York Times, the CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs, said that they waited so long because they wanted to be sure about exactly what was going on instead of rushing its public relations. According to Jobs, something this technical takes time to isolate and determine if it is real, and what is going on. He says that a week is relatively quick for the technicality of the issue. He then said that it is an important issue, and took the time to write the response personally and with other top executives.\nIt looks like the issue with the iPhone 4 is that there is a spot on the phone that will cause reception issues when covered with a bare hand. However, Jobs said that there wasn’t an antenna problem that was in need of fixing, and gave out cases free of charge.\nAlthough this incident seems to have had little effect on the popularity of the iPhone, or bother Apple’s devoted fans, experts say that they could learn from other companies such as Domino’s or Taco Bell about how to deal with public relations mistakes such as this. For example, when a video came out of a Domino’s employee doing disgusting things to the food was released, the employee was fired as was the co-worker who recorded him. Domino’s then released a statement apologizing and ensuring that they had sanitized their stores and would adopt a more rigorous hiring process.\nTaco Bell, on the other hand, spent millions of dollars to counter a lawsuit that had been filed against them claiming that their taco meat wasn’t actually beef. The lawsuit was dropped. Taco Bell realized that its customers care less about nutrition and more about price and taste.\nApple’s customers care little about their location being tracked, because many features of the iPhone rely on it, such as getting directions to nearby stores or restaurants.\nJ.
