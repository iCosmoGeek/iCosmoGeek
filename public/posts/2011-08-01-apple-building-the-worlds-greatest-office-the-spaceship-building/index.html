We’ve come up with a design that puts 12,000 people in one building. That may sound rather odd – 12,000 people in one building. But we have seen office parks with lots of buildings that get pretty boring very fast. So we’d like to do something better than that.”\nIn addition, he adds – “Our people use computers all day and if the power goes out on the grid we will have to send everybody home. So we have to have backup power in place in the event of brownouts and stuff. I think we will make our energy centre the primary source of power and use the grid as backup. We think that makes more sense. We can generate power with natural gas and other ways that can be cleaner and cheaper.”\nApple plan to break ground next year and to move in by 2015.\n",
