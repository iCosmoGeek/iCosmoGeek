For sure, Microsoft Surface will be directly competing with iPad market if the developers are ready to develop some innovating Metro apps.\nThe biggest feature of this device is the 3mm thick Touch Cover (similar to iPad Smart Cover but with a full multi touch keyboard). This super thin keyboard with an integrated kick stand, VaporMg-brand molded magnesium alloy looks pretty awesome. GeekWire demonstrates this innovative keyboard in the following video:\nThere are two Windows tablets in this family as of now and breaks down as below:\nSurface for Windows RT weighs in at 676 grams, and measures 9.3mm thick. It will be powered by a ARM processor and will sport a 10.6 ClearType HD Display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. It will have a microSD card slot, USB 2.0 connection, Micro HD Video support and 2x2 MIMO antennae. It will be configured with 32gb or 64 gb models. Surface for Windows 8 Pro will weigh in at 903 grams and measure 13.5mm thick. It will be powered by a third generation Intel Core processor and will also have a 10.6\" ClearType Full HD Display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. Windows Pro 8 will be fitted with a microSDXC slot, USB 3.0 connection, Mini DisplayPort Video and the 2x2 MIMO antennae. It will be configured in either 64gb or 128gb models. For full detailed specifications, refer this official document.\nThe early hands-on reports around the tech world are praising all over and received a promising feedback. Price and availability is still unknown. Head over to Surface.com and Press annoucement for more details after watching this promotional video:\nUpdate on July 31, 2012: A brief note in Microsoft’s latest 10-K filing with the Security and Exchange Commission specifies October 26 as the launch day for both its radically redesigned version of Windows and the in-house-developed tablet on which it will run. And again, those are only Windows RT based tablets. The Intel based tablets are expected about 90 days after this launch.\nWell, the official pricing is yet to be announced. A simple speculation could be - Windows RT products as low as $500-$600 and Windows 8 Pro Intel-based products ranging up to $1,000, or possibly higher.
