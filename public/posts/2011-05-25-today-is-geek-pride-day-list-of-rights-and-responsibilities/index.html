<p>Geeks can be in any field – Computer Geek, Internet Geek, Academic Geek, Politics Geek, Pop Geek, Film Geek, Food Geek, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a fun <strong>Geek Bill of Rights and Responsibilities</strong> that was originally published in a Spanish website and also in Wikipedia:</p>
<p><strong>Rights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The right to be even geekier.<br>
The right to not leave your house.<br>
The right to not like football or any other sport.<br>
The right to associate with other nerds.<br>
The right to have few friends (or none at all).<br>
The right to have as many geeky friends as you want.<br>
The right to be out of style.<br>
The right to show off your geekiness.<br>
The right to take over the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Be a geek, no matter what.<br>
Try to be nerdier than anyone else.<br>
If there is a discussion about something geeky, you must give your opinion.<br>
To save and protect all geeky material.<br>
Do everything you can to show off geeky stuff as a &ldquo;museum of geekiness.&rdquo;<br>
Don&rsquo;t be a generalized geek. You must specialize in something.<br>
Attend every nerdy movie on opening night and buy every geeky book before anyone else.<br>
Wait in line on every opening night. If you can go in costume or at least with a related T-shirt, all the better.<br>
Don’t waste your time on anything not related to geekdom.<br>
Try to take over the world!</em></p>
