    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Have you ever imagined a baby girl’s name as “Like”? Well, its real now! More recently, a family in Israel decided to name their child “Like” after the Facebook button.
The social networking site Facebook provided the inspiration for the couple – Lior and Vardit Adler. She could be all cute and precious, but how idiotic is to name ‘Like’?
They explain it differently -
To me it is important to give my children names that are not used anywhere else, at least not in Israel. If once people gave Biblical names and that was the icon, then today this is one of the most famous icons in the world, he said, joking that the name could be seen as a modern version of the traditional Jewish name Ahuva, which means “beloved.”

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What a frustrating day for all those Bloggers around the globe using Google’s Blogger service. Bloggers were unable to publish the posts for the past 20.5 hours and comments were also temporarily removed.
The service interruption happened after a scheduled maintenance work Wednesday night. Blogger experienced some data corruption that impacted Blogger’s behaviour. Since then, bloggers and readers may have experienced a variety of anomalies including intermittent outages, disappearing posts, and arriving at unintended blogs or error pages. A small subset of Blogger users (we estimate 0.16%) may have encountered additional problems specific to their accounts.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Since it’s release, Apple has been collecting location data on it’s users of the iPhone. This has been very worrisome to various users and privacy advocate groups. However, for a solid week, Apple has been denying that it tracks users locations at all. Finally, a security researcher released a data file that showed that the iPhone was in fact gathering location data. Apple released a list of 10 questions recently saying that the location data doesn’t store the physical location of iPhone users, but instead keeps a list of cell phone towers and Wifi hot spots around the user. It does this so the phone doesn’t have to listen for faint GPS signals from satellites. The fact that Apple took so long to release this report is a crisis, according to experts, that could have been averted had Apple been upfront about the usage, or lack thereof, of the location data. Immediately upon releasing their phones, they should have released a privacy policy making clear the exact usage of this data.

    <p>Do you remember Steve Ballmer toning ‘Developers, Developers, Developers…’ which had set the Internet surprise! Ballmer is quite passionate about technology and of course Developers.
Here is the original version of that video taken from YouTube -
Surprised? Now, this original video was remixed with fabulous lyrics. Listen now!
This is a must hear for every developer and check out the lyrics -
I’m a developer
in many senses of the word
cause I make these applications
but I also use these verbs
to make this music
I construct it line by line
just like when I’m coding
another software design
in both cases
its about design patterns
anyone can get the job done
its the execution that matters
I have many interests
sometimes they conflict
my creativity can usually be a benefit
but sometimes it keeps me
far too busy
but I can’t complain
because my life is hardly gritty
so I think i’ll sit back
and pen myself another ditty
why is it that Linus Torvalds
the only one that Gits me
did you get that reference I was using
or is the thought of source source control too confusing
may just lay myself down a Team Foundation
so I can test the objects of my creation
