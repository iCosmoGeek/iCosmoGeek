      <description>&lt;p&gt;I requested ChatGPT to assume the role of a prominent Indian journalist and come up with a list of questions that would be asked if Mahatma Gandhi were alive today. Subsequently, I asked for responses to these questions, embodying Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s perspective, vision, and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the interesting points and answers provided by ChatGPT impersonating as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about the current state of India and its relations with its neighbors, especially Pakistan and China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sad and disappointed that India and its neighbors have not been able to live in peace and harmony. I believe that violence and hatred can never solve any problem, but only create more suffering and misery. I wish that India and its neighbors could follow the path of non-violence and truth, and respect each otherâ€™s dignity and sovereignty. I hope that they could cooperate and collaborate for the common good of humanity, rather than compete and conflict for selfish interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
