Anyone in the US or UK can now go to [Skype.com](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FSkype.com%2F&h=vAQGvhGiL&s=1) (or [web.skype.com](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.skype.com%2F&h=jAQGsSB06&s=1)) and connect to Skype for Web instead of downloading the app.  
  
This means that if you’re using a public computer or one that doesn’t have Skype installed, you will still be able to access your calls and IMs.
