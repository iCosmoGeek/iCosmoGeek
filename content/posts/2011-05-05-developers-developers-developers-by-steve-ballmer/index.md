This is a must hear for every developer and check out the **lyrics** -

> _I’m a developer  
> in many senses of the word  
> cause I make these applications  
> but I also use these verbs  
> to make this music  
> I construct it line by line  
> just like when I’m coding  
> another software design  
> in both cases  
> its about design patterns  
> anyone can get the job done  
> its the execution that matters  
> I have many interests  
> sometimes they conflict  
> my creativity can usually be a benefit  
> but sometimes it keeps me  
> far too busy  
> but I can’t complain  
> because my life is hardly gritty  
> so I think i’ll sit back  
> and pen myself another ditty  
> why is it that Linus Torvalds  
> the only one that Gits me  
> did you get that reference I was using  
> or is the thought of source source control too confusing  
> may just lay myself down a Team Foundation  
> so I can test the objects of my creation_
> 
> _Chorus (Steve Ballmer)  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers_
> 
> _not a fan of jewelry  
> except for Ruby on Rails  
> I can use my skills  
> to increase my online sales  
> capitalize on the popularity of Facebook  
> or grill up some beats  
> so they declare me a great cook  
> never really been a big fan of insects  
> so I track down bugs  
> remove them when in test  
> make sure they never get pushed to production  
> but sometimes deadlines decide they get rushed in  
> I’m the same way  
> when it comes to my songs  
> perfection is the goal whenever the mic is on  
> I don’t want a bad verse to slip in the mix  
> cause it could look really bad  
> for Cory or smixx  
> only a fan of your behaviour  
> if its driven development  
> theres no sense of  
> adding features for the hell of it  
> complexity is irrelevant  
> whether its with music or software  
> your users have stories so you should be telling them_
> 
> _Chorus (Steve Ballmer)  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers  
> Developers Developers Developers Developers_
> 
> _seeing my creations  
> on others devices  
> after years of concentration  
> is nothing but priceless  
> whether its with software  
> or a song just like this  
> I put myself out there  
> so go on and hype this  
> Running 3 external monitors  
> off of my macbook  
> currently reviewer on a Windows Phone Pact book  
> now I got Steve Ballmer  
> and he’s bombing on this tracks hook  
> of course my QA’s on me  
> cause this app just crashed look  
> when I write my raps  
> never use a marker  
> constantly refactor  
> like I’m using Resharper  
> doing ad hoc deploys  
> and I’m always deliverin’  
> and I made that choice  
> regardless of dividends  
> creating all this noise  
> in some form  
> until the bitter end  
> stating with with my voice  
> theres no norm  
> that I can fit within  
> haven’t been sleeping  
> but using lots of REST  
> pass the mic back to who rocked it best_
