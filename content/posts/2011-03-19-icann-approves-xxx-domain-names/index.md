The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has now approved the **.XXX** top-level domain. The adult entertainment sites will officially be able to label their websites with a .XXX domain name ending a 10 year battle.

The resolution passed despite large-scale protests from the adult entertainment industry, which is angry that they will have to repurchase domain names.

Thousands of adult entertainment website owners recognize the business benefits of .XXX and have already applied to pre-reserve over 200,000 .XXX domains. **.COM websites have been able to pre-register their .XXX domain for free since last year, but others will be forced to pay up to $70 to make the change.**

We can expect a gold rush in purchasing .XXX domains and equally we will have to wait for how many countries will ban the .XXX sites from its first day.
