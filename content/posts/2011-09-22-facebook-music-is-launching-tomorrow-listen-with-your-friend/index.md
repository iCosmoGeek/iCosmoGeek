It is rumored that this music service is set to launch with collaboration Spotify, MOG and Rdio. Meanwhile, Techcrunch [spotted](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/facebook-music-listen-with-friends/) an interesting tweet from Facebook’s creative director Ji Lee:

> _The “Listen with your friend” feature in ticker is blowing my mind. Listen to what your friends are listening. LIVE._

Even though he deleted this tweet within hours, the post managed to grab a screenshot. In this tweet, Lee is describing a key Music service. Reportedly, not only will all music you’re listening to appear in the recently launched ticker, there will be also be a link to ‘Listen with your friend’. This link when clicked will allow you to listen along to the same song at the same time.

More details here in this blog after tomorrow’s event.
