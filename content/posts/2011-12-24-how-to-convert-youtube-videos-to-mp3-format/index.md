**Free is Best**  
One of the best aspects of the [YouTube to mp3 converter](http://www.youtube-to-mp3.com.au/) is that it is 100 percent free. There is also no limit on how many downloads you can perform, so you will no doubt find yourself venturing back to the website time and time again. This is a great way to get your favorite music in mp3 format without having to spend loads of money! The website urges all of its users to spread the word about the great service to as many people as possible so that they too can experience the convenience of downloading their favorite tunes.  
  
Depending on your Internet connection, the actual conversion and download process can take anywhere from a mere minute or as much as five minutes. In general, most people will see results within two to three minutes due to the fact that most online users rely on a cable or DSL Internet connection. Of course, if you are a bit behind in the times and use dial-up, the download will take a somewhat longer amount of time.
