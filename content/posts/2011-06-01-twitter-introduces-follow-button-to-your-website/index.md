From the official Twitter blog post -

> _For publishers and brands, adding the Follow Button to your website and using Twitter to stay connected with your audience is a powerful combination. People who follow your account are much more likely to retweet and engage with your Tweets, and to repeatedly visit your website. Adding the Follow Button to your website is quick and easy, and you can configure yours right now at twitter.com/followbutton._

You can also see the profile and latest Tweets of the account you want to follow by clicking the username next to the Button. If you want to try out yourself on your website, just head to the link [http://twitter.com/followbutton](http://twitter.com/followbutton "http://twitter.com/followbutton"), fill in the form and copy/ past the html code.
