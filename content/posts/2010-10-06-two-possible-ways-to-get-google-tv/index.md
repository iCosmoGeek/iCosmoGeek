In my last post, when I published about [Google TV](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/here-comes-google-tv-with-more-apps.html), readers were fascinated and started asking me how to get this amazing product.

For those who haven’t yet heard of it, Google TV is a a software platform for set-top boxes and HDTVs based on the Android OS. It is co-developed by Google, Intel, Sony and Logitech.

There are two possible ways to get Google TV (_at least for this fall_) –

- You need to get a standalone smart TV from [**Sony**](http://discover.sonystyle.com/internettv/) called **Sony Internet TV.** The Sony Internet TV provides richer internet access so you can browse the web just like you would from a computer. Seamlessly navigate between websites and TV channels or enjoy both at the same time. On the same screen.
