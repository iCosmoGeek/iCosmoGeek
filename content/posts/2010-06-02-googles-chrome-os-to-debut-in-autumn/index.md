Google said Wednesday it is planning to release its Chrome operating system, seen as a rival to Microsoft's Windows system, for free in the autumn.

"We are working on bringing the device later this fall," said Google vice president of product management Sundar Pichai at CompuTex Taipei, Asia's biggest IT trade show.

"It's something which we are very excited by ... We expect it to reach millions of users on day one," he said.

The open source operating system is based on the Chrome browser, which is designed to work exclusively with web applications.

More than 70 million people use the Chrome browser, according to Google.

However, the jury is still out on Google's ability to challenge Microsoft, analysts said, pointing out that it remains to be seen if hardware manufacturers will launch Chrome-based products.
