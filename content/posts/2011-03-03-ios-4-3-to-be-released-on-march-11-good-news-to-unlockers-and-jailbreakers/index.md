The major updates in this release include - 

> **AirPlay Enhancements** Get even more play out of AirPlay — the wireless technology that lets you stream content from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your HDTV via Apple TV  
> **Safari Performance** With the new Nitro JavaScript engine powering Safari, it runs JavaScript up to twice as fast as in iOS 4.2  
> **iTunes Home Sharing** Now you can play your entire iTunes library from anywhere in the house  
> **iPad Side Switch** Customize the switch on the side of your iPad to lock the screen rotation or mute the volume  
> **Personal Hotspot for iPhone 4** On the road, in an airport, at the park — now you can bring Wi-Fi with you wherever you go.

On the other side, the Dev team behind the unlocking and jail breaking procedures, confirmed that the iOS 4.3 baseband can be unlocked and jail breached without any problems in contrast to earlier versions. Good news for all those struck with the not-so-effective unlocking methods in 4.1 and 4.2 versions.
