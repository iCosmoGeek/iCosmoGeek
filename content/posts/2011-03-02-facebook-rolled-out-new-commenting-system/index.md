Today, Facebook rolled out a new commenting system for blogs and third-party sites. It launched updates to the Comments Box Plugin with new moderation tools as well as features to improve the distribution and quality of comments on your site.

According to a Facebook blog [post](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/472), the new commenting system will be a quick install for publishers, with a single line of code. Sharing comments on Facebook will, of course, be seamless.

The upgraded Comments Box uses social signals to surface the highest quality comments for each user. Comments are ordered to show users the most relevant comments from friends, friends of friends, and the most liked or active discussion threads, while comments marked as spam are hidden from view.

Facebook is working with third parties to include other authentication mechanisms, and at launch it’s including support for Yahoo IDs. But it’s missing some other major options — namely, Twitter and Google. It don’t support Twitter or Google logins.

Besides many advantages with this new plugin, there are cons like if you work somewhere that blocks Facebook, you comments plugin doesn’t work, the site may load slower, there are lot of people who won’t want to use Facebook to leave comments.
