Many of our friends administer one or more pages on Facebook, but there is one essential feature Facebook "forgot" to make - the option to get email alerts when somebody posts or comments on one of your pages.

Now, Facebook pages are getting an updated layout and several new features to help you engage with your fans more effectively. Here's some of what you'll be getting:

> - Notifications when fans interact with your page or posts
> - A place to showcase photos along the top of your page
> - A news feed for your page
> - The ability to Like and post on other pages as your page
