Googleâ€™s Honeycomb event is happening now and they have been showing sneak [peaks](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/google-releases-android-30-honeycomb.html) of it for the past few weeks. Android 3.0 Honeycomb is designed exclusively for tablets and Google has given a pretty big advancement in the user interface.

The new Android Market is very similar to AppBrain, but you can purchase apps directly from the web and push them to your phone.

Additional features of the Web Store:

- Lots of developer control to make app pages look attractive
- The page is laid out intelligently, with links to other apps by the developer, screenshots of the app -- in essence, it's just like any other App Store
- Sharing tools are built-in -- easy to send apps to friends, via Twitter, email
- If you open a Web Store link on your phone, it opens the Market.
- You can sort apps in a variety of ways -- compatibility (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc.), popularity, and so on
- You can see all of your installed/purchased apps.
