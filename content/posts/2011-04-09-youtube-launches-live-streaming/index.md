YouTube is going LIVE! Yes, with over 2 billion views everyday, YouTube is the largest place to watch videos recorded in the past.

Now, you can watch events taking place _**right now.**_

YouTube has rolled out initial phase of YouTube Live, which will integrate live streaming capabilities and discovery tools directly into the YouTube platform. You can find the most happening live events and add to your calendar right from [http://www.youtube.com/live](http://www.youtube.com/live "http://www.youtube.com/live")

The page contains information on events slated for today, tomorrow, and the next seven days. When you subscribe to one or more YouTube Live partners, you'll be notified of upcoming live streams on your YouTube homepage.

YouTube has history of streaming live events including musical events and cricket matches (like IPL) in the past, but the new live channel is a more broadcast style destination for real time entertainment.

Initially, the live-streaming beta program will only allow select YouTube partners "with accounts in good standing" to stream live content on the site.
