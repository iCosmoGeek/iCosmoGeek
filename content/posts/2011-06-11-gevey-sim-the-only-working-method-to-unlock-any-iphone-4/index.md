You may already heard of this hardware based unlock method – **Gevey SIM Interposer,** a Turbo SIM like piggy back sim card that allows you to unlock any iPhone 4 (all basebands up to **04.11.04** including **iOS 5 beta**) and does not even require to jailbreak your device.

This method is still questionable in terms of its legal issues and readers are encouraged to try at their own risk.
