Could it be **Microkia?**

According to [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/04/nokia-microsoft-announcing-partnership-next-week-possibly-invo/), it’s expected that Nokia will announce a new partnership at Capital Markets Day next Friday. The report strongly bruits with Nokia recently appointed CEO Stephen Elop (from Microsoft) and has clearly marching orders to take Nokia in a new, more profitable direction making **[Windows Phone 7](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/microsoft-officially-unveiled-windows.html)** as the operating system of choice moving forward, with Google’s **Android** also touted as a possible alternative to in-house software such as Symbian and MeeGo.

Can Nokia become another Samsung, LG or HTC? There’s clearly a market out there for sleek, sexy hardware running the latest and greatest OS and Nokia certainly knows how to do sleek and sexy.
