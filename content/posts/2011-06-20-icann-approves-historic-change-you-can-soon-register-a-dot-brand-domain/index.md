Soon after [approving](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/03/icann-approves-xxx-domain-names.html) .XXX top-level domains for adult websites earlier this year, ICANN today has approved a plan to usher in one of the biggest changes over the Internetâ€™s Doman Name System. The new program will significantly allow companies, organizations and cities to register their own brands.

You can soon think of .FACEBOOK, .TWITTER, .HOTEL, .APPLE and even .ANYTHINGYOULIKE !!

According to the official [message](http://www.icann.org/), the board vote was 13 approving, 1 opposed, and 2 abstaining. The Board approved a plan to dramatically increase the number of Internet domain name endings -- called generic top-level domains (gTLDs) -- from the current 22, which includes such familiar domains as .com, .org and .net. Applications for new gTLDs will be accepted from 12 January 2012 to 12 April 2012.

To be honest, if people check the domain name for to ensure anti phishing, then there could be more problems. On the other hand, ICANN surely thinks it can make loads of money from this decision.

What do you think?
