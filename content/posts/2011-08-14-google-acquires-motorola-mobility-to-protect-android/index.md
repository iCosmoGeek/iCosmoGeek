Well, what does this acquisition mean? Is this to protect the whole Android ecosystem? Google just acquired 17,000 patents specifically related to mobile. And we can expect the whole patent lawsuit issues to end in the near future. For those companies that have doubts about supporting Android, Larry Page says -

  

_This acquisition will not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform. Motorola will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. We will run Motorola as a separate business. Many hardware partners have contributed to Android's success and we look forward to continuing to work with all of them to deliver outstanding user experiences._

  

Soon after the acquisition, Google just posted some responses from its other Android partners in its site [http://www.google.com/press/motorola/quotes/](http://www.google.com/press/motorola/quotes/)
