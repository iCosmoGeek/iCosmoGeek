[Google](http://www.cosmogeek.info/search/label/Google) launched a music service in India to help users search for legal online streams and downloads, a move aimed at combating rampant digital piracy that has held back the country's entertainment industry.

Google partnered with three digital music providers who together have the rights to hundreds of thousands of Indian tracks, from Bollywood hits to Indian classical tunes. When Indian web users search for a track via Google, the company will tweak its search results so that its top search results will be streams and links offered by Google’s partners; **Saregama India Ltd**., **Saavn** and **In.com.

Google employed a similar tactic in the US, offering users the ability to listen to tracks from Lala.com (which was bought by Apple and closed down) and Myspace.

The search service is now live few minutes ago and can be accessed at [http://www.google.co.in/music](http://www.google.co.in/music "http://www.google.co.in/music")
