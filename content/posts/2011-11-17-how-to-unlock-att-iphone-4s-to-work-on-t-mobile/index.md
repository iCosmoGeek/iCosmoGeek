One of the iPhone hackers (developer of course) claims that he found a way to unlock the iPhone 4S without any hardware or software changes. This unlock seems to be working (I haven’t tried yet with my AT&T iPhone 4S) only with AT&T version only.

According to [Chronic](https://twitter.com/#!/chronic/status/137244739597639681), this procedure will assist you to use your iPhone 4S on T-mobile’s network with T-mobile SIM card. You will need to cut the T-mobile SIM to fit into micro SIM slot of iPhone 4S. Proceed at your own risk -

> Insert original carrier AT&T SIM card  
> Dial 611 for AT&T customer service hotline and drop the call  
> Turn on Airplane Mode  
> Take out AT&T SIM card  
> Insert T-Mobile SIM card  
> Make sure WiFi is off ( also tap on ‘Forget this Network” to make sure it doesn’t connect automatically later)  
> Switch off Airplane Mode and iPhone will search for network. This is followed by the Apple splash screen appearing.  
> Activation Required will be displayed on the screen  
> EDGE network will activate automatically – notice the ‘E’ on the top left corner of the screen  
> Wait for about 20-30 seconds and turn off the phone  
> Turn on iPhone and the same Activation Required screen will be displayed  
> When you see one signal bar, tap on Use Cellular Connection  
> Eject SIM card  
> Activation Required screen will be displayed the second time  
> Insert SIM card  
> Unlocked!
