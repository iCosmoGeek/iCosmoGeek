In an exclusive blog post today, Delicious says – “**No, we are not shutting down Delicious**”.

Yesterday, it wall all [confirmed](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/12/yahoo-is-shutting-down-delicious.html) that Yahoo was shutting down Delicious, one of the most popular bookmarking services.

> **_“Part of our organizational streamlining involves cutting our investment in underperforming or off-strategy products to put better focus on our core strengths and fund new innovation in the next year and beyond._**
> 
> **_We continuously evaluate and prioritize our portfolio of products and services, and do plan to shut down some products in the coming months such as Yahoo! Buzz, our Traffic APIs, and others. We will communicate specific plans when appropriate.”_**

This could be a terrible mistake as many of the users have already started switching to other services.
