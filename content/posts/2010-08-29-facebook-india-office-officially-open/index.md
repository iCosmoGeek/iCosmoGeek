Hot on the heels of Facebook overtaking Orkut as India’s most prominent social network with 21 million vs. 20 million unique visitors in July, the company officially opened its much anticipated office in Hyderabad earlier this week. Facebook Hyderabad is Facebook’s second International office, after Dublin, Ireland and the Indian team will include more sales and operations as well as multi-lingual support staff in order provide round-the-clock international support.

The office was opened in the traditional Indian way, and here is a video of the office opening. Highlights include American Facebookers awkwardly dancing Bollywood-style and an impressive Facebook cake!
