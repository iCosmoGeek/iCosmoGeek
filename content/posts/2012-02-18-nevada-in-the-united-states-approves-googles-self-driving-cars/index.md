**[Google’s self driving cars](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/google-cars-dont-need-driver.html)** vision is becoming reality now. Nevada has become the first state in the US to approve self-driving cars. Las Vegas is the largest city in this state. This could be the real future in the automobile industry.

Nevada’s Department of Motor Vehicles along with its Legislative Commission gave the stamp of approval provided that these autonomous test vehicles are distinguished from regular vehicles by a red license plate. Once the technology in the test vehicles have developed enough for public use, they will then carry a green license plate.

Here here is a video of the Google self-driving car in action shot back in 2010 in its initial testing phase -
