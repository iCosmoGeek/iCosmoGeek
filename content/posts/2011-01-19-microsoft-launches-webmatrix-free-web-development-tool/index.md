WebMatrix provides all the features you need in a single unified interface. You can easily edit your files, manage database and modify server settings – all at a single place. It brings together a Web server, a database, and programming frameworks into single, integrated experience. It lets you code, test, and deploy both ASP.NET and PHP applications side by side.

WebMatrix is the easiest way to learn standards-based Web development and makes it simple to build and publish Web sites on the internet. Start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then seamlessly connect to a database or add in dynamic server code using the new ‘Razor’ syntax for ASP.NET Web pages.

When a website is ready to be published, Web developers can seamlessly publish it to their own hosting provider or one available through WebMatrix. It includes a gallery of offerings from hosting providers that range in scalability and price based on users’ needs. An extensive group of more than 30 hosting partners including companies such as STRATO (Germany), DataJapan Corp. (Japan), Applied Innovations Corp. (U.S.), Fasthosts (U.K.), Infobox (Russia), Poundhosts (U.K.), MyHosting.com (Canada), NetMagic Solutions (India), Netissime (France) and Ikoula (France).
