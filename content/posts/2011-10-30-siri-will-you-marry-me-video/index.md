Apple’s latest undoubtedly biggie ‘Siri’, the digital assistant is making people crazy. People started asking her (or him or no gender as of now!) random questions and posting on the web.

It could be a humor to some extent and we all giggled. This video follows a group of friends who are asking Siri some questions. Before watching the video below, I am not sure whether this is legit in the first place and I never tried it on my [iPhone 4S](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/10/iphone-4s-unboxing-pictures.html).

Yes, this could be funny to some extent and for few days. Can we stop showing all those funny things and use Siri for useful things?
