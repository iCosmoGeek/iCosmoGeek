Microsoft has released an update recently to support the new currency symbol for the Indian Symbol for Windows.

Indian government has approved a standard symbol for Indian Rupee (just like $ US dollar sign) and later Unicode Consortium assigned a Unicode to that symbol so that it can be assigned to the standard keyboards.

Paper media and advertisers have started using the above symbol already. You need to use separate fonts or keyboards to actually type this symbol.

To avoid the extra installation, now, Microsoft has released an update so that you can directly type this symbol right from your Windows.

**Instructions:**

> 1\. Get the update from the download [link](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2496898) (_supports only Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2_).
> 
> 2\. Your computer should be running a genuine copy of Windows. There is no way to by pass this.
> 
> 3\. Open Office Word or WordPad (not supported in Notepad).
> 
> 4\. Type **20b9** and press **ALT + X** right after that and this automatically converts to INR symbol (₹).
