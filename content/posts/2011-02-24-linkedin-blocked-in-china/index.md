After the micro blogging site **Twitter,** it appears that **[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)** is the latest victim of the anti-government protests in China. The Great Firewall (read China) now blocked the professional social networking site **LinkedIn**.

The site had recently seen growth in China and was holding off the challenges of several clones like Ushi and Tianji. Protesters are moving from various social network sites, such as Twitter and LinkedIn, to organize protests.

It's downfall may be linked to recent events in China and it's connections to Twitter. Things may change, but right now you need a VPN to access the site from mainland China.

[Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com) contacted LinkedIn on the current issue and here is the update from LinkedIn:

> _We are aware of the reports of a disruption to our service for our members in China. We are looking into the situation now._
