Mona Simpson, an author, professor of English at the University of California and biological sister of Steve Jobs. In an October 16 Eulogy delivered for her brother at his memorial service at the Memorial Church of Stanford University, she told that her brother’s final words were **“Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”**

As published in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/mona-simpsons-eulogy-for-steve-jobs.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2), Mona remembered Steve she first learned about when she was 25. A lawyer had informed her that she had a rich and famous long-lost brother.

“If he loved a shirt, he’d order 10 or 100 of them,” she said, “In the Palo Alto house, there are probably enough black cotton [turtlenecks](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/10/steve-jobs-on-why-he-wore-black-mock.html) for everyone in this church”.

“Steve was like a girl in the amount of time he spent talking about love. Love was his supreme virtue, his god of gods. He tracked and worried about the romantic lives of the people working with him.”

Whenever he saw a man he thought a woman might find dashing, he called out, “Hey are you single? Do you wanna come to dinner with my sister?”

I remember when he phoned the day he met Laurene. “There’s this beautiful woman and she’s really smart and she has this dog and I’m going to marry her.”

Steve eventually grew ill.

Steve’s final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.

Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them.

Steve’s final words were:

**OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW.**
