This is not the “Unlike” button you are waiting for status updates! Rather, Facebook added an “Unlike Page” button for Pages feed.It has made dramatically easier to Unlike Pages and Open Graph objects.

Clicking on the small “X” button next to any update from a Facebook Page will list the regular options, “_Hide this post_,” “_Hide all by \[page\]_,” “_Hide all by \[app\]_” and “_Mark as spam_,” but also a new “_Unlike Page_” option.

This new easier Unlike flow may significantly increase the rate at which active Pages lose Likes. Page admins will need to extra take care not to exhaust, bore, annoy, or offend their audience.

Soon, we can now hope to see a “dislike” button for all news feeds including the status updates. We really want to see that right?
