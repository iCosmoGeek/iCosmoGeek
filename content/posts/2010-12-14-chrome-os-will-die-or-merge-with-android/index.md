He continued:

> _**ChromeOS has no purpose that isn’t better served by Android (perhaps with a few mods to support a non-touch display).**_
> 
> _**I was thinking, “is this too obvious to even state?”, but then I see people taking ChromeOS seriously, and Google is even shipping devices for some reason.**_

Confused by their simultaneous development of two different operating systems, Chrome OS and Android, Google has explained the distinction succinctly: **“Chrome is for keyboards, Android is for touchscreens.”**

Merging Android and Chrome OS would also give Android a good way on the competition, by offering both local and cloud based services all greatly integrated in a single package.
