You can also save it as draft from your iOS device and continue editing it while youâ€™re on the go. Blog posts are basically automatically synced across devices and you always have access to the latest version.

This app also allows to add pictures to your posts from your camera roll and also you can label posts, add location too. Additionally, you can add multiple blogger accounts if you have more than one blog. This app is not currently optimized for iPads.

If you are an Android powered device user, you can download the app from [Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.blogger) too.
