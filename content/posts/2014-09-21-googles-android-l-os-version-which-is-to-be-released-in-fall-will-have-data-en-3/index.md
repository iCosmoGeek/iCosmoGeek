Googleâ€™s Android L OS version which is to be released in fall, will have data encryption turned on by default. You may think that the company revealed this tidbit owing to all the recent security concerns following credit card hacks, celebrity photo leaks and government surveillance.  
  
The problem is that they don't have control to push this update to all devices and carriers don't bother at all!

The move raises yet another barrier to police who want to gain access to the troves of personal data typically kept on smartphones.
