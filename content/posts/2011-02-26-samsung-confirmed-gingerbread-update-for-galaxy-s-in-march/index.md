The news came out at the Samsung blogger event in Frankfurt and confirming Frank Feil [tweet](http://twitter.com/m4gic/status/41165120860065792). However, this update could only be available to European Galaxy S devices initially. US and India carrier specific variants will probably have to wait a long time.

In India, Samsung has phased out this super successful **I9000 Galaxy S** device and launched an updated version **[Galaxy SL I9003](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/02/samsung-galaxy-sl-arrives-in-india-for.html).**
