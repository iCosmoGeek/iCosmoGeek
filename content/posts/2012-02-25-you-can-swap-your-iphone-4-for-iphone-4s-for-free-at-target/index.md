Target, one of the largest retailers in the U.S. is starting a new promotion from this Sunday, February 26th on iPhones. This trade-in promotion will actually works out better if you really want to swap your old iPhone 4 with the new iPhone 4S. Well, this kind of upgrade could be almost free if your old device is in perfect condition.

As this is a trade-in offer, you can still buy other items in the store. And if you still hold one of those old iPhone 3GS or iPhone 3G, you still have the option. The old phones can still get you up to $150 depending on the condition.

If you have any plans to upgrade to iPhone 4S, I recommend you to check out this [online link](http://target.nextworth.com/search/1/cat/iphones/) before you head to the local store. Make sure you run to the store starting from Feb 26 to March 3. The catch of course is that youâ€™ll have to sign up for a new 2 year contract.
