The hacker behind Dev team and iPhone unlock leader **MuscleNerd** tweeted few hours ago about the unlock for Apple’s new device iPhone 4S.

According to his [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/MuscleNerd/status/140767335828033536), a very promising unlock for iPhone 4S is in the works. That’s only for iPhone 4S now! Not for iPhone 4.

UltraSn0w which lets you to unlock the iPhone to use on different carriers currently only supports on the basebands for iPhone 3GS - 4.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, and 06.15.00; for iPhone 4 -  01.59.00. No other basebands are currently not supported by UltraSn0w.

Now that the Dev team tweeted on the latest iPhone 4S's unlock, all those users who are eagerly waiting to unlock their devices (who accidentally updated to latest basebands) may get some good news in next few days.

As usual, I’ll update on those unlocking and jailbreaking procedures as and when released.
