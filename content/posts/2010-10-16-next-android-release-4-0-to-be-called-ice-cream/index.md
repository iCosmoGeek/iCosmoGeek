According to [Forbes](http://blogs.forbes.com/elizabethwoyke/2010/10/15/next-android-release-to-be-called-ice-cream/?boxes=techchanneltopstories), the codename for Google’s 4.0 firmware of the **Android** operating system will be codenamed “**Ice Cream**”, following the alphabetical naming procedure used by the search giant, to follow Gingerbread (3.0) and Honeycomb (3.5).

The custom naming of **Android** operating system began in May 2009 as below:

> **C**upcake – Android 1.5 in May 2009
> 
> **D**onut – Android 1.6 in Sep 2009
> 
> **É**clair – Android 2.0 in Oct 2009
> 
> **F**royo – Android 2.2 in May 2010
> 
> **G**ingerbread – Android 3.0
> 
> **H**oneycomb – Android 3.5
> 
> **I**ce Cream – Android 4.0

Ice Cream won’t be introduced until mid-2011. Gingerbread is expected to be released before the end of the year and Honeycomb in early 2011.
