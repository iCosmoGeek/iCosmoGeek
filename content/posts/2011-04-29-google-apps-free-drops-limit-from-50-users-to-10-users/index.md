Google is changing the way it is doing its business under new CEO [**Larry Page**](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/eric-schmidt-stepping-down-as-google.html) and it wants to open up your wallets.

With 3 million customers, Google Apps which was launched 5 years ago is helping small businesses in means of Email, Calendar, Docs, and many [more](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/05/google-apps-to-become-more.html).

Now, Google is making some changes to its licenses – some good news and bad news. Here is the update received from Google Apps Team to its customers -

> _Hello,_
> 
> _We recently announced upcoming changes to the maximum number of users for Google Apps. We want to let you know that, as a current customer, the changes will not affect you._
> 
> _As of May 10, any organisation that signs up for a new account will be required to use the paid Google Apps for Business product in order to create more than 10 users. We honor our commitment to all existing customers and will allow you to add more than 10 users to your account for \*\*\*\*\* at no additional charge, based on the limit in place when you joined us._
> 
> _Sincerely,_
> 
> _The Google Apps Team_

Reducing the limit to 10 users for the free version is actually a bad news compared to 50 users to this point. On the other hand, the good news is that there is also a new Flexible Plan with monthly billing and no contractual obligations.

From the blog [post](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/04/helping-small-businesses-start-and.html) -

> _First, for customers who sign up online we’re adding the Flexible Plan, a new $5 per user per month pricing option which requires no contractual commitment – one of the most flexible plans in the industry today. With this plan, businesses can add or remove users as necessary and will automatically be billed for the proper amount. We’ll continue to offer the current pricing option – $50 per user per year with a one-year commitment – as the Annual Plan._

Schools and non-profits that qualify for Google Apps For Education will not be affected with these new policies.
