Even with dedicated IT departments, businesses and schools struggle with the complex, costly, insecure computers. Staging, imaging, updating and repairing software problems are some of the daily activities - a typical IT department is responsible for.

Crashes, long boot times, application conflicts, endless updates, viruses, security issues and obsolete hardware all frustrate IT managers and end users - and most users don’t need or want the complexity and annoyance of their current PCs.  
On the second day of Google I/O 2011 event, May 11, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, announced the first set **Chromebooks**. These are not typical notebooks.

A Chromebook boots up in just **8 sec** and resume instantly, automatically installs software updates and your apps, games, photos, music, movies and documents will be accessible wherever you are and you won't need to worry about losing your computer or forgetting to back up files.  

Chromebooks will last a day of use on a single charge, so you don’t need to carry a power cord everywhere. And with optional 3G, just like your phone, you’ll have the web when you need it. Chromebooks have many layers of security built in so there is **no anti-virus software** to buy and maintain. Even more importantly, you won't spend hours fighting your computer to set it up and keep it up to date.  

These are -

> Easy to manage
> 
> Security built in
> 
> Dramatically lower cost
> 
> Painless migration
> 
> One place to shop – directly from Google

More features include -

1. Administrators can configure and manage Chromebooks and user accounts centrally through the web. You don’t need to perform backups or migrate data when changing hardware.
2. With minimal data stored on the Chromebooks, there is little need to worry about a lost or stolen computer. Each page and app runs in a restricted environment called ‘**sandbox’**.
3. If anything goes wrong with your Chromebook, you can simply push a button to enter the **hardware-backed recovery mode** and restore the operating system to a known good version.

Chromebooks will be available online June 15 in the US, UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. More countries will follow in the coming months. In the US, Chromebooks will be available from Amazon and Best Buy and internationally from leading retailers.

Monthly subscriptions will start at **$28/user for businesses** and **$20/user for schools.**
