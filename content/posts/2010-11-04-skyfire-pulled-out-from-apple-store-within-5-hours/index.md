As I mentioned [earlier](http://www.facebook.com/cosmoGeek#%21/cosmoGeek/posts/166768423346943), Flash on iPhone or iPod touches and similar iOS devices is possible through world’s hottest mobile browser – **SkyFire.**

The beauty of SkyFire is you can watch videos including Flash while browsing your favourite sites. It has private browsing and user agent switching modes too.  
Apple took 2 months to approve SkyFire in App Store – but only took them a few hours to pull the plug on this app that converts Flash content to HTML5. 
**Why do you think SkyFire was taken down?** According to SkyFire [blog](http://www.skyfire.com/press/blog/68-skyfire-reaches-top-grossing-app-on-iphone-app-store-within-5-hours-sold-out), the popularity of the app is costing them a fortune in bandwidth, which is necessary to convert the videos from Flash to HTML5. 

> Skyfire for iPhone has been received with unbelievable enthusiasm. Despite our best attempts and predictions, the demand far exceeds our initial projections.  
> The user experience was performing well for the first few hours, but as the surge continued, the peak load on our servers and bandwidth caused the video experience to degrade.  
> Thus we are effectively **‘sold out’ and** **will temporarily not accept new purchases from the App Store**.  We are working really hard to increase capacity and will be accepting new purchases from the App Store as soon as we can support it.  
> We are very grateful for the demand. Within 5 hours, Skyfire for iPhone became the top grossing app, the third highest paid app overall and the top application in the Utilities category. Wow!

  
**Update:** It seems things are getting better now as SkyFire is now back in the App Store. You can try to [download](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyfire-web-browser/id384941497?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) SkyFire here at the same price tag of $2.99
