According to the official [post](http://support.twitter.com/articles/452648-i-m-having-problems-logging-in-to-ubertwitter-or-twidroyd) from Twitter, it has suspended **UberTwitter** and **Twidroyd** for violating its policies.

Summary of the post -

> “_Regardless of how you access Twitter, we are dedicated to making Twitter better, faster and more reliable for you. As part of this effort, we ask applications that work with Twitter to abide by a simple set of rules that we believe are in the interests of our users, and the health and vitality of the Twitter platform as a whole. We often take actions to enforce these rules.  
> We have suspended UberTwitter and twidroyd for violating our policies.  
> Every day, we suspend hundreds of applications that are in violation of our policies. Generally, these apps are used by a small number of users. We are taking the unusual step of sharing this with you because today’s suspension may affect a larger number of users”_

This is a big news itself. **UberMedia**, which recently acquired UK-born **TweetDeck**, carries more than 20% of tweets sent daily. The privacy issues are related to handling Tweets longer than 140 characters and monetization.

Meanwhile, UberMedia resubmitted its apps, with UberTwitter BlackBerry app re-emerging as **UberSocial.** It seems that Twitter doesn't like the marks "Tweet" or "Twitter" being used by third parties.
