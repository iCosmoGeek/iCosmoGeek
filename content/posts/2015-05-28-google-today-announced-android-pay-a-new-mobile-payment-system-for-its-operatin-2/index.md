Google today announced Android Pay, a new mobile payment system for its operating system that lets people purchase items with their smartphone, similar to Apple Pay.  
  
It follows Google Wallet, the companyâ€™s first mobile payment software that debuted in 2011 but not so popular.  
  
Why not they just say - "We tried to do Google Wallet, but the experience & marketing was terrible, so now it works like Apple Pay. LOL"
