Google CEO Larry Page appoints Sundar Pichai to lead nearly every product at the company.  
  
According to ReCode, Pichai will take over Google Research, web search, Google Maps, Google+, advertising, commerce, and the company’s growing infrastructure, although his title won’t change, and he’ll still report to Page.
