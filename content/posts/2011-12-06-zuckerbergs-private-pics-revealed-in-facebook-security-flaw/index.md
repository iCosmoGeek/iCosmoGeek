A security flaw in Facebook has been discovered which may reveal your private photos. The world’s largest social networking website with an estimated 850 million users confirmed this bug and issued a statement that it has been fixed.

The exploit allowed the hacker to dig into Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/zuck) inside photos section and revealed some private photos. Before you try this how exactly it works, Facebook might have already fixed this bug.
