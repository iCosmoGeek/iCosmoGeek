In its continuing attempts to make the web faster, Google is trimming down the size of image files, which make up about 65% of the bytes on the web. Google announced that it is releasing a developer preview of a new image format **WebP**.

An alternative to the JPEG format, which is typically used today for web pictures and images, WebP should "significantly" reduce the byte size of images, [Google](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/09/webp-new-image-format-for-web.html) promises.

> Most of the common image formats on the web today were established over a decade ago and are based on technology from around that time. Some engineers at Google decided to figure out if there was a way to further compress lossy images like JPEG to make them load faster, while still preserving quality and resolution. As part of this effort, we are releasing a developer preview of a new image format, [WebP](http://code.google.com/speed/webp/), that promises to significantly reduce the byte size of photos on the web, allowing web sites to load faster than before.
