More than a decade ago, Bill Gates introduced the world an entirely new concept of computing – Tablet PC. However, the tablet boom really kicked off when [Apple](http://www.cosmogeek.info/search/label/Apple) brought the magical iPad.

And here is the exciting news from **[The New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/microsoft-to-announce-new-slates-targeting-ipad/)** -

> Next month, at the 2011 [Consumer Electronics Show](http://www.cesweb.org/) in Las Vegas, Microsoft will give it another try, presenting a slew of new slates that it hopes will offer some competition to the Apple iPad, which has quickly become the leader in this market.

The post mentions that Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, is expected to  announce a number of these devices when he takes the stage at C.E.S., showcasing devices built by Samsung and Dell. Another interesting news mentioned in the post is Steve might demonstrate a tablet and other companion devices running the next operating system **Windows 8**.

Thus far Microsoft has remained tight-lipped about Windows 8, though there have been [leaked documents](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-many-details.html) that have helped paint a clearer picture of its possible launch timeline and planned feature set.

Windows 8 is expected to be another [revolutionary](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/ballmer-windows-8-will-be-riskiest.html) release to the Windows product line expecting Facial recognition, True-Instant On, Windows Store, and more – all evolutionary, nothing revolutionary!

Do you think what Microsoft has in store? Can this really be the iPad killer?
