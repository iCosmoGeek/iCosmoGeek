**Wow! I can’t believe you’re ONE already!**

Its officially the one year birthday of [www.cosmoGeek.info](http://www.cosmoGeek.info) and I can’t tell you how excited I am to have made it this far. I’ve loved every minute of this tech blogging covering the most excited happening around Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.

With **19,282 Pageviews**, **11,605 visits**, and more than **290 posts** – this one year, I’ve enjoyed the support of every tech blogger around the globe.

Thank you everyone for your support, your encouragement, and your comments. I look forward to the next year, and hope its just as good or even excellent!
