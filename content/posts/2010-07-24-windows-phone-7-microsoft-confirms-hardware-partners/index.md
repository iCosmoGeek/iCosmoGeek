Microsoft has confirmed the hardware partners that will be launching Windows Phone 7 handsets

Greg Sullivan, senior product manager for Microsoft, told that he could expect handsets from **Dell, Asus, LG, HTC, and Samsung** at the launch later this year.

It confirms certain former rumors.

We always thought Dell would be launching a Windows Phone 7 device, the Dell Lightning.

And HTC exclusively confirmed to us that it was also launching a Windows Phone 7-powered handset too.

In our meeting, Sullivan referenced an LG Pacific, possibly a renaming of the LG Panther doing the rounds, but refused to be drawn further.

Microsoft is using a Samsung device for developers to preview and work with the new OS, but has categorically stated that Samsung isn't releasing the handset (pictured) in that form.

That's five launch handsets, some of which, Microsoft has already confirmed, will include a QWERTY keyboard, as well as a full touch screen experience.
