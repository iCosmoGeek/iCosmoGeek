Recently, Apple [admitted](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/04/apple-location-tracking-is-bug-and-it.html) that location tracking (which stores your location to a database file) as a bug and will be fixing in upcoming iOS software update.

Even, I tweeted on April 28 (Osama was killed after that!) that someone should give Osama Bin Laden an iPhone before Apple updates iOS in a funny way! Did Apple help Obama administration find Osama using this iOS bug?
