Last week, people were buzzing over Facebook [Phone](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/09/facebook-is-building-phone.html), now its time to give some to Mozilla. Earlier today, Mozilla labs unveiled **Seabird –** an Android based concept phone.

You may have seen a lot of mobile phone concepts, but the one you are going to see below will blow you away, seriously this is one of the best concepts ever made. It was created Billy May, a community member in the [Mozilla Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/09/23/seabird/) community.

Seabird is a community-driven exploration and does not mean that Mozilla has plans to produce an OS or hardware at the moment.
