Google Apps users now have the option to play with circles. Google+ is now available to people who use Google Apps at college, at work or at home. These users will have the same set of features that are available to every Google+ user.

In addition to sharing publicly or with your circles, you’ll have the option to share with everyone in your organization, even if you haven’t all of those people to a circle.

- Drag down to Google+ and turn ON the feature. You may get a warning for it to have Picasa Web Albums and Google Talk features will be turned on for all of your users.
- Finally, save changes

You may have to inform your users that you’ve enabled Google+ for their accounts and information in signing into Google+.
