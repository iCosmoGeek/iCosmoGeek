This little girl decided to give her dad a hand. She wrote his employer, which happens to be Google, a letter, asking that they cut him some slack with the work schedule and Google responded!  
  
The letter reads:  
  
Dear Google Worker,  
  
Can you please make sure when daddy goes to work, he gets one day off. Like he can get a day off on Wednesday. Because daddy only gets a day off on Saturday.  
  
From, Katie  
  
P.S. It is Daddy's BIRTHDAY  
  
P.P.S. It is summer, you know
