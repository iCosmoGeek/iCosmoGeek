Here's something you probably didn't know your iPhone could do: display movies in 3D.  
Actually, it can't quite yet. But a company called Spatial View is launching an online 3D movie store, [3DeeCentral](http://www.spatialview.com/3deecentral/), and it has submitted an app that grants access to it for review by Apple.

It’s not going to be native three-dimensional video but still offers similar results and the cool thing is you won’t have to wear those _hideous_ polarized glasses! 3DeeCentral should be available later in the fall and should cost < $20 when it releases for iOS and Android devices.
