Before the much hyped Apple’s iPad HD (or iPad 3?) [event](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2012/02/official-apple-has-just-sent-ipad-3.html), Google introduced a new cloud based media platform called **Google Play** which is similar to Apple’s iTunes. Google Play will be the users’ one place shop for movies, music, apps, games and books. The giant integrated the current Android Market, Google Music too into this new service.

And similar to Apple’s iCloud, Google said on its official blog [post](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/introducing-google-play-all-your.html) that all your purchased content will be backed up automatically so there is no need to worry about losing your purchases.

To celebrate the promotion, Google will be offering a different album, book, video rental and Android app at a special price each day for the next week in ‘7 Days to Play’ sale.
