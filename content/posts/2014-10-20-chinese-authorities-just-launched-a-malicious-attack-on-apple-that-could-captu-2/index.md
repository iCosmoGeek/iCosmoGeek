Chinese authorities just launched “a malicious attack on Apple” that could capture user names and passwords of anyone who logs into the iCloud from anywhere in the country, the well-respected censorship watchdog [GreatFire.org](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FGreatFire.org%2F&h=cAQGMHC1D&s=1) reports. With that information, a hacker can view users contacts, photos, messages and personal information stored in the cloud.  
  
As of last night, the Chinese firewall is blocking all local connections to [iCloud.com](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FiCloud.com%2F&h=rAQEIhT7Q&s=1), redirecting those connections to a dummy site designed to look exactly like Apple's login page. If you're using Firefox or Chrome, you'll land on a warning page like the one above, but if you're using Qihoo, the most popular browser in China, you'll be routed straight to the dummy site with no indication that it's not being run by Apple. A similar attack is also being leveled against Microsoft's [Login.live.com](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FLogin.live.com%2F&h=5AQHiEfuD&s=1), the company's gateway for all account logins.

This is clearly a malicious attack on Apple in an effort to gain access to usernames and passwords and consequently all data stored on iCloud such as iMessages, photos, contacts, and more.
