With Android 2.3 just days away from its official release, Google has decided that the Android Market should get redesigned. In a blog [post](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/12/android-market-client-update.html), Google made an announcement that this market client update will be rolled out in over next two weeks to all devices running Android 1.6 or higher.

Users can quickly flip through the carousel to view promoted applications and immediately go to the download page for the application they want.

In addition to these changes, Google is also adding more information about apps on a single page so you don’t have to bounce around to get the details you want on a particular app. It’s also going to add app content ratings, and Google will shorten the amount of time one can request a refund on an app in the Android Market to 15 minutes.
