According to a press release issued by the company, Apple admits iPhone 4 reception problems as ‘Incorrect Signal Display’. The iPhone 4 doesn’t have a hardware design flaw – it has a software bug.  
_"We were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong," says Apple. "Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength."_

They promise their software update will fix the way the iPhone 4 displays signal bars. However, they don't claim the software patch would solve the signal attenuation problem caused by holding the iPhone 4 and touching the dead spot on its left bottom corner. The software patch will show the drop more accurately in the signal bar display.
