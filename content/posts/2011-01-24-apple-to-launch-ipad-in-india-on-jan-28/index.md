Just when almost every Indian who ever aspired to buy the iPad officially in India had given up the hope and gone for the grey market route, at last, Apple decided to finally launch it in India. iPad will be launched in India on Jan 28th, and will be available only through Appleâ€™s premium retailers.

For those who are familiar with the iPhone, the iPad is about the size of six iPhones put together. The iPad comes in two versions. One operates solely through Wi-Fi. The other with a SIM card with data connectivity and also with Wi-Fi.  
The Wi-Fi version of the iPad will be sold in three versions: 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB. The price will vary from Rs 26,000 to Rs 37,000. The Wi-Fi that will come with a 3G SIM card will cost between Rs 33,000 and Rs 44,000, depending on the storage capacity of 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  
I am very disappointed that Apple took this long time to launch the iPad here. With the second generation iPad ([iPad2](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/iphone-5-and-ipad-2-wait-for-these.html) ?) launch just three months away from now, does it mean that we won't be getting it on time as well? Something tells us the answer is "Yes".
