Today, Google sent out a notice that it would be holding a press event Thursday morning at its San Francisco offices, where the search giant would be “unveiling a couple of cool new mobile features.”

Google mobile product management director Hugo Barra will demo the additions, which some think should include integrated video calling in the Android mobile operating system.

But many think Google (GOOG) should aim higher sooner, since it is critical that Android get off the stick in the video calling arena, especially given that Apple (AAPL) is reportedly planning an aggressive expansion of its FaceTime software in its many devices.

Other than integrated video calling, another feature that should be on Android users’ wish lists to match Apple might be a “find my phone” offering directly from Google, rather than from app providers, that can be used to retrieve lost or stolen mobile devices, as well as lock and wipe them.
