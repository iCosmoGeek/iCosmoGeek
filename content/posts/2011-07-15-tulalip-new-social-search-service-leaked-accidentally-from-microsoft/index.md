Microsoft accidentally revealed an internal test version of its research design project **“Tulalip”** yesterday.

A teaser landing page has been revealed by [Fusible](http://fusible.com/2011/07/new-microsoft-social-search-service-called-tulalip-revealed-on-socl-com/) and it appears to be a new “Social Search” service by Microsoft as shown below.

The company has been hosting these new details at [www.socl.com](http://www.socl.com). The site which is now taken offline reveals some interesting features which allows you to sign in using Facebook and Twitter.

Message appeared on the home page:

> _With Tulalip you can Find what you need and Share what you know easier than ever_

Microsoft confirmed in a statement that [www.Socl.com](http://www.Socl.com) is an internal design project from one of the research teams which was mistakenly published to the web. The site now updated to reflect the mistake as below:

> _Thanks for stopping by._ 
> 
> _Socl.com is an internal design project from a team in Microsoft Research which was mistakenly published to the web._
> 
> _We didn’t mean to, honest._

So, what do you think? The software giant was once again preparing its own social network to compete with Facebook, Twitter and Google+ ?
