In case if you are busy tasting those Google’s sweet Android versions, guess the next version of Android coming after Ice Cream Sandwich? According to a blog [post](http://thisismynext.com/2011/09/09/android-jelly-bean/) by Chris Ziegler of This Is My Next, the next version is going to be named as **“Jelly Bean”.**

We do not even know the exact version of latest Android Ice Cream Sandwich which is going to debut in late October or early November along with next Nexus handset. This has been confirmed by Eric Schmidt few days [ago](https://twitter.com/#!/k_avinash/status/111591146572095490). Samsung is expected to release this handset with name **Nexus Prime.**

More interestingly, this new Android version, Jelly Beam may include some major game-changing stuff. Even though this choice of naming is not finalized by Google, the pickings should start with “J” letter in the series of desserts.

Meanwhile, here is the current list of Android versions in alphabetical order as of now:

> 1.5 Cupcake
> 
> 1.6 Donut
> 
> 2.0 (Éclair)
> 
> 2.1 (Éclair)
> 
> 2.2 (Froyo)
> 
> 2.3 (Gingerbread)
> 
> 3.0 (Honeycomb)
> 
> 3.1 (Honeycomb)
> 
> 3.2 (Honeycomb)
> 
> 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)
