If you are one of those unlockers patiently waiting for an unlock for **iPhone 4** other than baseband **01.59.00,** here is some bad news for you.

According to the recent [tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/MuscleNerd/status/45598114446454784) from iPhone Dev Team (_team behind the unlocking and jail breaking procedures_) member MuscleNerd, it is taking longer than expected to get the unlock figured out.

Earlier, I thought that **[iOS 4.3 update](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/03/ios-43-to-be-released-on-march-11-good.html)** would be a good news for all those struck with the not-so-effective unlocking methods in 4.1 and 4.2 versions. And if you are still on baseband 01.59.00, you can always jailbreak and unlock using UltraSn0w. Beginners who don’t know about Jail breaking at all, search for ‘jailbreaking’ in this blog using Google custom search located at the top right corner and you will get some good info.
