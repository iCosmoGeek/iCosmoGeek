Apple recently announced the next iOS version, **iOS 5** which includes amazing new features â€“ notification centre, improved home screen, and much more.

Even though this is in beta, there is a weird bug where the OS crashes on the whole when the music app is launched with earphones or headphones plugged in. I am not sure this is only specific to 3rd generation iPod touches but the bug is still present in **iOS 5 beta 2** (it is even present in Beta 1) which is released on July 24, 2011.

> **Product**: 32 GB iPod Touch (3rd generation)

> **Problem:** Whenever I play music with headphones plugged in, the OS crashes!

> **Temporary Solution:** In order to listen to music without crash, play music first, wait for few seconds, and plug in your headphones!

Here is a short video (from my mobile phone in low quality) where I managed to capture this evening
