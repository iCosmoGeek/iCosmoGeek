We have seen many smartphones that are currently powered by dual-core processors, but HTC is making ahead of the race with four cores. This new device could be the **HTC Edge** reportedly launching in first or second quarter next year.

Rumors suggest that this device has a  4.7 HD display, 1GB RAM, 8MP camera, 21Mbps HSDPA networks.

According to [Pocketnow](http://pocketnow.com/android/htc-edge-first-quad-core-phone-revealed-images), the device likely comes with NVIDIA’s 1.5GHz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, 32 GB internal storage, beats audio. We can obviously expect Android in it.

Edge may also see the rollout of new or improved HTC content services such as HTC Listen music store, HTC Read bookstore, and HTC Play gaming hub; the HTC Watch movie portal will reportedly begin to offer HD fare.

Do you really care about processor or battery life of your phone?
