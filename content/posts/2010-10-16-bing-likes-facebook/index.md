Microsoft has announced that Bing will partner with Facebook to deliver personalized search results based on your social network.

Bing will enable a great search experience for people queries, by bringing in information from your Facebook friends and people who share networks with you, and will show you what your friends have liked as you navigate through search results in Bing.  
A new feature called _Liked Results_, which uses Facebook “like” information to help you discover new information and get more personalized results in Bing. _Facebook Profile Search_ on Bing also lets you find old friends or discover new ones.
