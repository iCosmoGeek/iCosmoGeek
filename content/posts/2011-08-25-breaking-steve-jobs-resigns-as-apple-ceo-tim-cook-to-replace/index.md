I am very sorry to say that the most innovating icon in this world, Steve Jobs is stepping down as Apple's CEO with effective immediately. He suggested COO Tim Cook to replace him who has been carrying out most of the operations over last several months. Even though he officially resigned, Jobs will still be actively involved in Apple's future.

I could go on and write about Steve's innovations, revolutions and accomplishments but I recommend to read the official [biography](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/04/steve-jobs-official-biography-coming-in.html) which is going to be released in early 2012. This man started Apple in his parent's garage and after several problems the company now turned into the empire. His pet projects are all at ultimate level - Macintosh, iMac, OS X, iPod, iPhone, iPad.

  

Complete resignation letter which Steve himself sent to the board:

  

_"To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:_

  

_I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come._

  

_I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee._

  

_As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple._

  

_I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role._

  

_I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you._

  

_Steve"_

  

I still remember those legendary words, dialogues...One last thing; Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone; and many more. What a legend! I can't wait writing about his whole life stroy in this blog.
