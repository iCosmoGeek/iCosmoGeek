Apple started shipping iPad 2 from March 11 in US and from March 25 in UK, Canada and 25 other countries. Unfortunately, India is in the list in near future with Apple just releasing old iPad 1 just few weeks ago.

You can pre-order iPad 2 starting at Rs. 36,500 via **Shop Your Word (SYW).** SYW is a decently new global online shopping website with a main focus on Indian customers. They offer users a way to shop products from US & UK (other countries?) and deliver them to their door-steps without worrying about the shipping and customs.

As of now, this site has Wi-Fi only models and Apple lockage of 3G version to AT&T/Verizon could be the reason for not having 3G model.
