The [rumours](https://twitter.com/#!/k_avinash/status/80097265628360705) were true now! You can now officially buy an unlocked iPhone 4 from Apple Retails US Stores.

Apple is selling the 16 GB version of unlocked GSM iPhone 4 for **$649** and 32 GB for **$749** while the locked versions are still available for $199 and $299 respectively.

Interestingly, these unlocked iPhones will work on supported GSM carrier networks around the world. Because the unlocked iPhone is sold without a contract commitment, you can establish service and use a micro-SIM card from a local carrier at your destination.

However, youâ€™re [probably aware](https://twitter.com/#!/k_avinash/status/72721767071887360) that a new iPhone might be coming out soon in September. In fact, new iPhone hardware has reached final testing stage prototypes.

If you are an Apple fan, spending as huge as $650 on a brand new iPhone a few months before a new model can be a great disappointment.
