A startup is offering a virtual girl friend for you on Facebook! To make it look like you are not single, [**Cloud Girlfriend**](http://cloudgirlfriend.com/jzfvs) promises to post things on your Facebook wall.

The application yet not launched defines Cloud Girlfriend as “**the social network girlfriend**” asking users for their email addresses to be notified. It claims -

> Step 1: Define your perfect girlfriend.
> 
> Step 2: We bring her into existence.
> 
> Step 3: Connect and interact with her publicly on your favorite social network.
> 
> Step 4: Enjoy a public long distance relationship with your perfect girl.

Its kind of a social experiment and they may come out with some cupid style experimental posts. If at all this concept is successful, its going to get shutdown soon by Facebook for creating fake users and violating conditions unless there are no automated scripts.
