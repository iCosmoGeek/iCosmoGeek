From the MSDN blog, new features in Silverlight 5 include -

> **_New features in Silverlight 5 include Hardware Decode of H.264 media, which provides a significant performance improvement with decoding of unprotected content using the GPU; Postscript Vector Printing to improve output quality and file size; and an improved graphics stack with 3D support that uses the XNA API on the Windows platform to gain low-level access to the GPU for drawing vertex shaders and low-level 3D primitives._**

Even though there is no word on its finality, we can expect Microsoft to soon stop this product in accordance to HTML 5.
