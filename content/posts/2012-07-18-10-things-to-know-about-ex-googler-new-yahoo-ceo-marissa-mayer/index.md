Yesterday, Google's first female engineer, Marissa Mayer, resigned. After spending 13 years at Google, she begins her career as Yahoo's new CEO at the age of 37.

She is 'product focused' and focused on the 'user experience'. She is good at mentoring talent. At Google, she was responsible for Google's popular products: the simple white search homepage, Gmail, Google News, and Google Images.
