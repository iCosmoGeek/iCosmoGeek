FBI created fake Seattle Times news story in scheme to implant spyware on bomb-threat suspect’s computer. The tactic worked when the story appeared in the suspect’s MySpace feed, leading to the arrest of a 15-year-old who had been threatening to blow up a high school near Olympia.  
  
The only problem - The Seattle Times had no idea that the FBI created this fake URL. Ethical or not?
