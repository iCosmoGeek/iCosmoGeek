Windows Blue, Windows Server Blue, Windows Phone Blue, Windows Services Blue. The one thing missing from this list of next-generation Microsoft releases is a Blue version of Office. Is there one? Microsoft’s next generation of Office software looks like it’s going to be a rebel and not follow Microsoft’s new “Blue” codename.

The software will instead go by the codename “Gemini”, and it will be composed of two waves that will be released over the next two years. The first wave will be released alongside Windows Blue, and will bring updates to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.

According to _ZDNet_, there is a group inside the Microsoft Office team called the Modern Office Experience (MOX). Their prime goal is making Office more Metro for Windows 8 and future Windows Blue users.

Along with the Gemini release, Microsoft plans on developing a touch version of Office in the near future. The touch-based Office will be targeted more towards Windows RT devices, that will have consumers see Office as more than just a desktop-based application.
