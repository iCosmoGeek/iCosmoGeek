A famous blog has pointed out a shocking security flaw in Facebook that allows users to see the live chats.

There is an option in privacy settings, under personal information and posts, that allows you to preview your profile as it would look to one of your Facebook friends. You are then able to select one of you friends and view it, literally, from their eyes.

The feature works so well, that if your friend happens to be live chatting at the time, you will see their conversations in action.

Steve O'Hear posted the video below, showcasing the problem.

**Update:** After a few hours Facebook sent us this statement.

“For a limited period of time, a bug permitted some users’ chat messages and pending friend requests to be made visible to their friends by manipulating the “preview my profile” feature of Facebook privacy settings. When we received reports of the problem, our engineers promptly diagnosed it and temporarily disabled the chat function. We also pushed out a fix to take care of the visible friend requests which is now complete. Chat will be turned back on across the site shortly. We worked quickly to resolve this matter, ensuring that once the bug was reported to us, a solution was quickly found and implemented.”
