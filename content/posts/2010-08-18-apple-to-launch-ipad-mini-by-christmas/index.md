Yes, the rumours of a mini iPad are rife once more, thanks to a stated sighting of the so-called iPad 2 by a Taiwanese newspaper. This follows reports last week in a different Taiwanese newspaper, of a similar Apple story.

The Economic Daily News, a Chinese-language newspaper, has reported that a smaller version of the current iPad will be available in time for Christmas.

The new Apple device will be built along similar lines as the iPad but with a 7 rather than a 9.7 inch screen. And companies in Taiwan have won a number of contracts to build the components.
