Google introduced ‘Google TV’ almost five months ago to the world at Google I/O and today they have got all new updates to this amazing product.

For those who haven’t yet heard of it, **[Google TV](http://www.google.com/tv/)** is a new way to think about TV: it’s a platform that combines your current TV programming and the open web into a single, seamless entertainment experience.

It is the tech giant's attempt to bring the full Internet to TV sets, via new TVs and Blu-ray players from **Sony** and a set-top box from **Logitech**. Google won't say when exactly Google TV is launching, but it is expected in mid-October. Logitech is having a press conference Wednesday in San Francisco, where it's expected to reveal its launch date, followed by a Sony press conference on October 12th.

Google TV will come pre-loaded with apps like Netflix, Twitter, CNBC, Pandora, Napster, NBA Game Time, Amazon Video On Demand and Gallery. Starting early next year, apps from Android Market will work on Google TV as well.

Designers already started enhancing their existing websites for an optimal viewing experience on Google TV. Starting early next year, developers will be able to create and sell Android apps for Google TV.
