In the latest unusual rhetoric dispute, Apple says that Samsung “**attempts to harass**” it and that Samsung’s demands are not made in good faith in one of its most recent filings.

For some background history, Samsung demanded Apple to provide it with the samples of its next generation iPhone and iPad prototypes. [Earlier](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-over-plagiarism.html), Apple sued Samsung over Galaxy series plagiarism. These incidents are unusual considering that Samsung is one of the Apple’s key suppliers, probably the largest one.

Florian Mueller writes on the FOSS Patents blog [post](http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/06/apple-feels-harassed-by-copyist.html) about the complete story. Main point include -

> _Samsung's Motion to Compel is an improper attempt to harass Apple by demanding production of extremely sensitive trade secrets that have no relevance to Apple's likelihood of success on its infringement claims or to a preliminary injunction motion. Apple made a compelling showing in its motion to expedite discovery that Apple needs samples of products that Samsung has already announced, distributed, and described, so that Apple can evaluate whether to file a preliminary injunction motion against those products, which look strikingly similar to the distinctive trade dress of Apple's current products. Samsung has made no such showing about Apple's future products. Therefore, Samsung's Motion to Compel should be denied._
