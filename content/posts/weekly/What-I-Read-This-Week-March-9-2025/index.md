# Summary
OpenAI is set to charge $20,000/month for AI agents aimed at PhD-level tasks, with SoftBank backing its expansion. Governments' AI race misses the potential of collaboration, while "Severance" TV show explores how our work selves shape our identities. The ongoing debate over birthright citizenship highlights the power dynamics in America’s history. Larry Page’s new AI startup, Dynatomics, is set to revolutionize manufacturing. Meanwhile, anti-aging breakthroughs remain unproven, with current techniques still experimental.

## OpenAI Plots Charging $20,000 a Month For [PhD-Level Agents](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-plots-charging-20-000-a-month-for-phd-level-agents?rc=wgyu13)
ChatGPT’s $4B revenue is just the start. OpenAI’s real play is AI agents, with top-tier models priced at a staggering $20,000 a month—taking on PhD-level research and high-stakes development work. SoftBank’s $3B commitment shows just how big this could get. OpenAI expects agents to drive 25% of its revenue. The future of work won’t come cheap—and it’s arriving fast.

## The Government Knows A.G.I. Is Coming [[podcast]](https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010014641/the-government-knows-agi-is-coming.html?smid=url-share)
Nations are obsessively racing to outpace each other in artificial intelligence development, believing dominance ensures security. This zero-sum mentality ignores the reality that AI's true power lies in collaboration, not competition. By fixating on supremacy, we risk escalating tensions and missing opportunities for shared progress. It's time to rethink our approach: cooperation, not rivalry, is the key to harnessing AI's full potential.

## Surreal “[Severance](https://www.economist.com/culture/2025/03/06/surreal-severance-brilliantly-captures-the-reality-of-office-life)” brilliantly captures the reality of office life
We pretend our work selves are masks, but what if they’re closer to the truth? You spend more of your life at the office than anywhere else — those habits, decisions, and relationships shape you deeply. “Severance” TV show on Apple TV+ makes this reality inescapable: the work self and home self aren’t opposites; they’re two sides of one identity. Maybe the version of you in that fluorescent-lit maze is more authentic than you think. What if the mask is the one you wear at home?

## [Birthright Citizenship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBFX4EuAWHc): America’s Unfinished Promise
The 14th Amendment wasn’t a loophole — it was a declaration of equality. Yet nearly 200 years later, we’re still debating who deserves to belong. The Dred Scott decision, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and today’s political fights all reveal one truth: citizenship has always been about power, not principle. The real question isn’t about law — it’s about who we choose to include. Are we ready to honor our own ideals?

## Larry Page Has a New AI Startup: [Dynatomics](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/larry-page-has-a-new-ai-startup?rc=wgyu13)
Larry Page’s new company, Dynatomics, aims to obliterate the old way of making things. By merging large language models with hyper-optimized design, they plan to turn factories into on-demand creators of revolutionary products. This isn’t just automation — it’s AI-driven reinvention. Traditional manufacturing won’t see this coming. And by the time they do, it’ll be too late.

## The Illusion of [Anti-Aging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/06/cellular-reprogramming-longevity-reverse-aging/) Breakthroughs
Despite sensational headlines, current cellular reprogramming techniques remain experimental and unproven in humans. While studies have shown potential in reversing aging in mice, translating these findings to human therapies is fraught with challenges and uncertainties. The complexity of human biology means that what works in animal models may not directly apply to people. Moreover, the long-term effects and safety of such interventions are still unknown. It's crucial to approach these developments with cautious optimism, recognizing that true anti-aging solutions are still a work in progress.
