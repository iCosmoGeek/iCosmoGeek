# Summary
This week’s reading took me through a mix of thought-provoking and practical topics: Satya Nadella’s vision for Microsoft’s AI and quantum future, xAI’s powerful Grok 3 launch, and a chilling documentary on the disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370. I also explored debates around smartphone bans in schools, the surprising downsides of elite tutoring, a game-changing cash-back credit card from U.S. Bank, and strategies to stand out at work.

# Grabbed My Attention

## Dwarkesh Patel's [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GLSzuYXh6w) with Satya Nadella - Microsoft’s AGI Plan & Quantum Breakthrough
Satya Nadella breaks down Microsoft’s big bets on AI and quantum computing. He lays out a clear thesis: AI isn’t just about fancy tech; it needs to drive real economic growth—like 10% global GDP kind of growth. Microsoft’s making serious moves in quantum, unveiling the Majorana 1 chip, which uses a new topological superconductor to stabilize qubits. If they nail this, quantum goes from science fiction to reality. He also talks about AI's impact across industries, from gaming to enterprise, and the need for legal guardrails to keep things in check. Bottom line? Microsoft isn’t just playing in AI; they’re trying to own the future.

## Grok 3 [announcements](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3)
xAI just launched Grok 3—built on the Colossus supercomputer, it’s 10x more powerful and smarter in reasoning, math, and coding. It crushes AI benchmarks, scoring 93.3% on AIME 2025 and 79.4% on LiveCodeBench. Grok 3 Mini offers a lighter, cost-effective version. The ‘Think’ button lets users tap into deeper reasoning. Bottom line? xAI isn’t just in the AI game—they’re pushing to lead it.

## Documentary on Malaysian Flight 370
I found this YouTube [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkTo9Rk6_4) on (the [Boeing 777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370) that seemingly disappeared without a trace in 2014) to be fascinating and horrifying.

## Do [bans](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/02/14/do-bans-on-smartphones-in-schools-improve-mental-health) on smartphones in schools improve mental health?
Banning smartphones in schools sounds like a quick fix, but the data doesn’t back it up. Mental health struggles among teens run deeper than screen time, and schools alone can’t solve the problem. Until tech companies stop hoarding user data, we’re debating blindfolded.

## Parents Who Hire Elite Tutors Are Setting Up Their Kids for Failure Tutors do homework
Rich parents aren’t setting their kids up for success—they’re crippling them with dependency. Over-tutored children learn to outsource effort, while their peers build resilience, intellect, and grit. A paid-for "A" won’t prepare them for life—only struggle and failure can. Read an interesting article from [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/relationships/parents-who-hire-elite-tutors-are-setting-up-their-kids-for-failure-a4a9e73d).

## US Bank Smartly [4% Credit Card](https://thefinancebuff.com/us-bank-smartly-visa-review-setup.html)
I too jumped on the bandwagon on this. Why settle for 2.625% cash back when U.S. Bank's Smartly Visa offers a straightforward 4% on every purchase? By transferring $100,000 in investments to U.S. Bancorp Investments, you can maximize your rewards without the hassle of annual fees or spending categories. It's time to rethink your loyalty to traditional banks and embrace a more rewarding strategy.

## Need to Get Noticed at Work? [Do This First](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/work-promotion-raise-strategy-taking-notes-fa677313?mod=workplace_more_article_pos6)
Stop relying on vague recollections and start documenting your wins with cold, hard facts. When layoffs loom or reviews roll around, a well-kept record isn’t just helpful—it’s your strongest defense. The professionals who get ahead aren’t just great at their jobs—they’re great at proving it.
