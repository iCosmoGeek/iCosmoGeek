A tabloid has claimed that Apple founder, Steve Jobs, is stricken with pancreatic cancer and may have just six weeks to live.Â  The National Enquirer has published new pictures of the man behind the iPod, iPhone and iPad suggesting that the things are worse than Apple would have the world believe.

This breaking news originated from RadarOnline.com, its unknown whether Jobs' current health battle is related to his liver transplant from 2009, or whether the pancreatic cancer he previously defeated has returned, or if there is a new problem.

Furthermore, the National Enquirer's next issue features pictures (via Gizmodo) of a "skeletal-looking" Jobs outside the clinic, though it's pretty hard to tell if that's actually Jobs or not.

I hope that the Enquirer is wrong and wish him luck with his treatment.
