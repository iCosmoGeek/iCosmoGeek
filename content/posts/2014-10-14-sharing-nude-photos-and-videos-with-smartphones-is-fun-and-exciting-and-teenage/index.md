Sharing nude photos and videos with smartphones is fun and exciting, and teenagers aren't going to stop doing it, hacks or no hacks.  
  
This new photo-sharing app, Yovo, uses a common optical illusion and protects your naked pics with a brilliant optical illusion.  
  
Yovo places blurred lines above the images you send, and those lines move across the screen very quickly so they aren't perceived by the human eye. If someone tries to take a screenshot of a photo, however, the blurred lines mask much of the image.
