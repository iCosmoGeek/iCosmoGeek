Now that Microsoft has released Office 2010 Final build officially to public, you can download the 60-day trial version from the link [http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/download-office-professional-plus/default.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/download-office-professional-plus/default.aspx "http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/download-office-professional-plus/default.aspx")

After installing it, user will have initial 30 days of free evaluation period before having to activate the product for lifetime continuous usage. Now to extend this expiry period to 6 months, we have to **REARM** the product. _(Just follow the steps below instead of searching for REARM!)_

Just run **OSPPREARM.EXE** located at the following folder with elevated permissions in command prompt

_C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform_

Change above path accordingly depending on your system drive and 32bit/64bit OS.

A total of 5 rearms is possible, where after reset, additional 30 days of free usage is allowed without proper activation. When timed correctly to rearm Office 2010 at last day of current cycleâ€™s expiration days, the 5 rearms can extend and prolong the free usage of Office 2010 to half a year long.
