Is Facebook launching a web-based Email Client? According to TechCrunch, Facebook may introduce it on its Monday’s special event.

This full featured webmail product is a secret project from Facebook known as **Titan.** This is unofficially and over-enthusiastically known as **Gmail Killer.**

It could just a UI refresh for Facebook’s existing messaging service with POP access tacked on.

Hang on for more updates and do not miss your desired personal **@facebook.com** username if this biggy is true.
