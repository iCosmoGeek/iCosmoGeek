What a frustrating day for all those Bloggers around the globe using Google’s [Blogger](http://blogger.com) service. Bloggers were unable to publish the posts for the past 20.5 hours and comments were also temporarily removed.

The service interruption happened after a scheduled maintenance work Wednesday night. Blogger experienced some data corruption that impacted Blogger’s behaviour. Since then, bloggers and readers may have experienced a variety of anomalies including intermittent outages, disappearing posts, and arriving at unintended blogs or error pages. A small subset of Blogger users (we estimate 0.16%) may have encountered additional problems specific to their accounts.

Yesterday, blogger returned to a pre-maintenance state and placed the service in read-only mode while restoring all content. It restored to May 11th version.

This is a second scenario recent days in cloud computing after [Amazon’s](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/04/what-happened-to-amazon-yesterday.html) service disruption.
