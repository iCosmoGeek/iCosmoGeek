Quick Tip:  
  
Ask any tech person how to make your computer faster, and almost every one of them will tell you to Defrag your PC. But do you really need to manually trigger a defrag these days?  
  
Quick answer is NO.  
  
(Fastest) Windows with an SSD Drive: Don’t Defrag.  
  
Windows 7, 8, or Vista: It’s automatic, don’t bother. (check to make sure the schedule is running)  
  
Windows XP: You should upgrade. Also, you should setup defrag on a schedule.
