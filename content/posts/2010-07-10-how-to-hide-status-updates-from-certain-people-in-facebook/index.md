The other night, when I started roaming in and around outskirts of the City of Pearls, I updated my status on Facebook - ‘_At Shabad, Charminar...2.15 am...having dinner in 'Chowki' style! Jagne ki raat’_ via text message.

When we reached home in the early morning at around 4.30 am - one of my friends who came along with us started worrying about my status message – _his brother might see my FB message and acquaint his parents the real story!_

So, this tutorial helps in hiding status updates from certain people in Facebook.

Using Privacy Settings, you can select whether everyone, just friends or friends of friends can see your status updates. However, there is a way to narrow those options down even further.

You can select specific friend lists to see your status (relevant for work, special interest groups, etc.) or even individual people by name, which is useful for anyone organizing a surprise party.

To take advantage of this option, go to your Privacy Settings from Account button located at top right of your Facebook page. In the next page, click ‘Customize settings’
