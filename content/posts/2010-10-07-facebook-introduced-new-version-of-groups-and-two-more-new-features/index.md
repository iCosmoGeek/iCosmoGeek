Last night, I’ve covered live updates of Facebook event in cosmoGeek’s Facebook [fan page](http://www.facebook.com/cosmoGeek) and as well as on my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/k_avinash) account.

To summarize, Facebook yesterday revealed 3 new features - a new version of Groups, an option to download _your_ _information_ locally, new dashboard for apps you use.

**1.   New Facebook Groups** Until now, Facebook has made it easy to share with all of your friends or with everyone, but there hasn't been a simple way to create and maintain a space for sharing with the small communities of people in your life, like your roommates, classmates, co-workers and family

‘New groups’ is a simple way to stay up to date with small groups of your friends and to share things with only them in a private space. You can also _group chat_ with members who are online right now!

Got to [http://www.facebook.com/groups/](http://www.facebook.com/groups/ "http://www.facebook.com/groups/") to create new groups.

**2.   Download Your Information** Facebook now allows to quickly download to your computer everything you've ever posted on Facebook and all your correspondences with friends: your messages, Wall posts, photos, status updates and profile information. You will soon find this option under your _Account Settings_.

**3.   New Dashboard** Lastly, Facebook is now launching new dashboard to give you visibility into how applications use your data to personalize your experience. As this rolls out, in your Facebook _privacy settings_, you will have a single view of all the applications you've authorized and what data they use.
