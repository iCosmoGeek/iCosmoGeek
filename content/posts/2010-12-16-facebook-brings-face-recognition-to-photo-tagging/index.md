Today, the social network giant Facebook boosted the usability of its photo sharing and tagging product to enabling **_auto tagging_** of photos. Wonder how? It uses its _**face recognition**_ feature to detect a person and then utilize your network of friends as reference to place tags on the people visible in the picture.

A "tag suggestion" feature crafted to identify people in uploaded pictures should be rolled out to all US users in the next few weeks. Now if you upload pictures from your cousin's wedding, Facebook will group together pictures of the bride and suggest her name!

People who don't want their names automatically suggested in photo tags can disable the feature by adjusting Facebook privacy settings.
