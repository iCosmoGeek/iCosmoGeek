The "iPhone on Verizon" topic is hardly new at all. Earlier this year analysts predicted that AT&T may lose exclusive deal for the iPhone with Apple and that Apple may plan to bring the iPhone to another carrier.

The model that has CDMA capability, used by Verizon Wireless, is being manufactured by Pegatron Technology Corp. One person familiar with the situation said Pegatron is scheduled to start mass producing the CDMA iPhones in September, but it was unclear when Apple might make the model available.

This is definitely a brilliant news for all the consumers out there who want to explore the iPhone with more carrier options. However! WSJ's word on this is not to taken as last because previously such reports have been proved to be false.
