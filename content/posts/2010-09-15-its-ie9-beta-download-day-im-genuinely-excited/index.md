I’m Genuinely excited! I don’t remember feeling this way when Chrome 6, Firefox 3.6 or Opera 10.60 were released — and IE9 is just a beta.

There are several reasons -

- IE9 is the first version to support HTML5, CSS3, SVG, canvas and several other technologies.
- It's clean, simple, fast and beautiful design here's no menu bar, no Favourites Bar, no Command Bar, and no Status Bar.
- The new One Box, which combines address bar and search functionality into a single UI
- IE 9 notifications are now at the bottom of the window, are less obtrusive, and won't interrupt your browsing experience.
- Windows 7 Integration – You can pin website shortcuts to the Windows 7 taskbar just like local applications
- Download Manager with SmartScreen Filter - At long last, IE gains a download manager
- Full hardware acceleration, scripting performance, HTML5 and other web standards, compatibility mode, Dev Tools
