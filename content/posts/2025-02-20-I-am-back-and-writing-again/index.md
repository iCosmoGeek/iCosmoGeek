Hello, dear readers!

It’s been a while—quite a few years, in fact—since I last wrote regularly on this site. But after this long break, I’m excited to say that I’m back and ready to write consistently again.

To kick things off, I’ll be starting a new series: *weekly summary posts* every weekend. These posts will feature the most interesting articles, essays, and insights I’ve come across from around the web and other sources. Think of it as a curated collection of thought-provoking ideas, stories, and trends that caught my attention—delivered straight to you.

I can’t wait to get back into the rhythm of writing and sharing with you all. If you’re interested in staying updated, be sure to check in on the weekends.

Looking forward to this new chapter. Let’s get started!
