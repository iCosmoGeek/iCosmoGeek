Microsoft is doing decently good with their recently launched Windows Phone 7.5 platform. I had a chance to test some of its exciting features on Samsung Focus i917.

Just like Apple’s iOS App Store alternative for jailbreakers – **Cydia,** Windows Phone 7 users get an alternative apps distribution platform to Windows Market Place, known as **Bazaar.**

These alternative platforms let in apps that are rejected from the official App Store or Market Place. Just like Apple’s App Store, Microsoft’s Market Place is a well monitored and closed system unlike Google’s Android market. All apps that are submitted that are submitted for App Store or Market Place goes through a strict screening process. If an app is found to be violated guidelines set by Apple or Microsoft, it is rejected and sent back to the developer.

4\. Connect your Windows Phone device now and sync with Zune

5\. Now, again from **Application Deployment**, click **Deploy**.

6\. You device should now have Bazaar installed

As noted on XDA forum, Bazaar is currently in early Beta stage of development, and at this time, when clicking install any app from Bazaar, the app will just download and will not install it.

Let me know if you tried out this procedure and face any problems.
