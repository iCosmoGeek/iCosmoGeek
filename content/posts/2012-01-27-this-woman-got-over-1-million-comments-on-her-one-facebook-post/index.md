This woman told [Fox40](http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-woman-gets-over-a-million-comments-on-facebook-post-20120126,0,6356388.story) that there are some wordy comments on the post, a lot of them consist of just the word ‘go’. If 107 of her friends participated in posting 1,001,291 comments – each person posted an average of 9357 times. The group submitted their post to the Guinness Book of World Records, but has yet to hear if they actually set the record.
