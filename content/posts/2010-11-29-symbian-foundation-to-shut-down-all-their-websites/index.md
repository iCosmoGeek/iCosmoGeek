Nokia announced earlier in the month that they’d be taking over the development side of Symbian, and that the Symbian Foundation will make the transition to a licensing operation.

The next stage of the transition was [announced via their Wiki](http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/Symbian_Foundation_web_sites_to_shut_down) recently, and involves closing the virtual doors on all of the Symbian Foundation’s websites come December 17th.

Every single website — including the source code, kits, wiki, bug database, reference documentation, and Symbian Ideas hosted on them — will be removed from the web.

If you want access to any of the above-mentioned resources, you can contact the Symbian Foundation directly and ask for it on a physical medium (such as flash drive/USB hard drive) sometime after January 31st. Note that this may incur a shipping and handling fee.

To be explicit, the following sites are marked for the chopping block:

- [www.symbian.org](http://www.symbian.org), [www.symbian.org/cn](http://www.symbian.org/cn), [www.symbian.org/jp](http://www.symbian.org/jp)
- [developer.symbian.org](http://developer.symbian.org), [developer.symbian.org/cn](http://developer.symbian.org/cn), [developer.symbian.org/jp](http://developer.symbian.org/jp)
- [horizon.symbian.org](http://horizon.symbian.org)
- [ideas.symbian.org](http://ideas.symbian.org)
- [blog.symbian.org](http://blog.symbian.org), [blogcn.symbian.org](http://blogcn.symbian.org), [blogjp.symbian.org](http://blogjp.symbian.org)
