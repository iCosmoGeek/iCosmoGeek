AT&T announced today new data plans (more expensive now!) for smartphone and tablet customers with large data allocations – but they are taking out the least $15 plan.

The new plans replace existing $15 and $25 plans with $20 and $30 (with an increase in bandwidth of course!).

Existing customers can keep their existing plans if they want to, and all new contracts taken out from Sunday will automatically use the new plans.

According to the official press [release](http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=22240&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=33672&mapcode=consumer|mobile-devices) -

> _“Customers are using more data than ever before,” said David Christopher, chief marketing officer, AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets. “Our new plans are driven by this increasing demand in a highly competitive environment, and continue to deliver a great value to customers, especially as we continue our 4G LTE deployment.”_

The **new smartphone plans** include:

- DataPlus 300MB: $20 for 300MB + $20 for each additional 300MB
- DataPro 3GB: $30 for 3GB + $10 for each additional GB
- DataPro 5GB: $50 for 5GB, with mobile hotspot/tethering, + $10 for each additional GB

In comparison, the **older data plans** price is as mentioned below:

- DataPlus: 200 MB for $15 + $15 for each additional 200MB
- DataPro: 2 GB $25 + $10 for each additional GB
- Tethering: DataPro + $20/month (additional 2 GB of data included)

The **new tablet plans** include:

- The existing 250 MB for $15
- AT&T DataConnect 3GB: $30 for 3GB
- AT&T DataConnect 5GB: $50 for 5GB

Needless to say, current users keep their old plans. But taking out of the 250 MB (for $15) is really bad because paying $5 more for just 50 MB increase is not a good move. No option for new customers from this Sunday, January 22. Your thoughts?
