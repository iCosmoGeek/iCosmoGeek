According to sources, the next version of iPhone OS, which is set to release this June will have Bing as its default search engine in Mobile Safari. Microsoft and Apple have reportedly been in talks over a possible search deal since January of this year, but since then there has been no real news on this.

After all the recent conflicts over Android, the removal of Google Search from iPhone shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise. Google has been rumored to be paying around $100 million dollars a year to Apple for the search rights, and ads that serves on the iPhone.
