Are you aware of [Google Gravity](http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google_gravity/)? It is an experiment created by Hi-ReS! wherein the objects from the Google frontpage will all fall down  once you load the site.

The only downside of this feature is that it the expected results are only visible using Google Chrome. Don’t try to do this using other browsers or you’d end up disappointed. It never works in IE, but somewhat works in Firefox though.
