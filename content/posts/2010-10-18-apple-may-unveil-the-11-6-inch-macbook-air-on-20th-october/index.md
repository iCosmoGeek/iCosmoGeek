There aren’t many more details available yet, but one source mentioned that Apple is forgoing the option of a traditional hard-disk drive or solid state (SSD) drive. Instead, the company may offer something that’s called an **“SSD Card**” that “lacks a traditional drive enclosure and more closely resembles a stick of RAM”, AppleInsider writes.  The site believes that the component may be an Apple-specific SSD drive built to integrate with Macs similar to how flash memory is used in iPhones, iPods, and iPads.
