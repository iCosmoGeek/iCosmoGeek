Microsoft is testing a microblogging service – Office Talk that is much like Twitter.  
OfficeTalk is being developed by OfficeLabs, the MS lab for testing internally developed ideas.  
The service looks almost identical to Twitter.

Few words from the official website:  
_“Ever wish you could share information broadly within your organization without emailing everyone? Ever wish you could keep the pulse of what people in your organization think is interesting? Microblogging has that potential. OfficeTalk is a concept test to explore the value of microblogging in the enterprise. OfficeTalk is deployed internally at Microsoft and has seen over 10,000 visitors and hundreds of messages posted daily. We're now making OfficeTalk available to a few customers in a small pilot test. Because this is an early-stage concept, the OfficeTalk microblogging experience itself looks very similar to other well-known services.”_
