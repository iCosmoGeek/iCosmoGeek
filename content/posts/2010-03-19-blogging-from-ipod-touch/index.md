Hello there...last night before sleeping I started exploring some of the free Apps in Apple Store from iPod Touch and I found one interesting app - BlogWriter. I have downloaded and installed it on the way. Once launched for the first time, it asks for your credentials. The interface is simple, try it out and I forgot to mention that this post is from that app!
