After a dramatic turn of events earlier in the week of Twitter’s [suspension](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/02/twitter-suspends-ubertwitter-and.html) on UberMedia’s popular apps UberTwitter and twidroyd under the auspices of privacy, monetization and trademark violations; UberMedia has had its API access reinstated for at least two of its apps.

From official Twitter [post](http://support.twitter.com/articles/452648-i-m-having-problems-logging-in-to-ubertwitter-or-twidroyd):

> ##### UPDATE 2/20/2011:
> 
> _We've given the developers of twidroyd and UberSocial for Blackberry (formerly UberTwitter) access to the Twitter API again. Our initial review indicates that steps have been taken to remedy the violations for these applications._
> 
> _When the developer updates twidroyd and Ubersocial, you'll be able to download their updates to access Tweets again on these applications._

UberMedia’s Blackberry and iOS Twitter client, UberTwitter, has been renamed to UberSocial and will hopefully return to full use again, as well.

**Update:** **Twidroyd** is ready. You can find it here http://twidroyd.com/mobile/. **UberSocial** is also now available at [http://bb.ubersocial.com/bb/download.php](http://bb.ubersocial.com/bb/download.php "http://bb.ubersocial.com/bb/download.php").
