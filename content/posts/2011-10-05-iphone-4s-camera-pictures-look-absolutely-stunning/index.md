Apple posted some sample shots taken using the iPhone 4S’ powerful camera which was [announced](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/10/iphone-4s-a5-dual-core-8-mp-camera.html) yesterday. In the official Apple’s website, Apple states that these photos are **unretouched** which means that they weren’t altered with any photo editing software after being taken.

According to Apple, this 8 megapixels and all-new optics camera might be the best camera ever on a mobile phone. Needless to say, these pictures are absolutely stunning. A real competitor to DSLR camera?
