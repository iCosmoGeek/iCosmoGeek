Google has rolled out a new feature of creating pivot tables in **[Docs](http://docs.google.com/)** starting from 17th of this month to all its users. **Pivot tables** make it easy to process and summarize large data sets in seconds. It allows you to “pivot” or rotate data, thus looking at it from different angles and seeing a variety of patterns which may not be immediately obvious.

Read more about Pivot Table from Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table).

With each change, the pivot table is updated in real-time for both you and any collaborators. If you prefer to make changes in batches, you can switch to manual mode. In this mode, your changes won’t be saved until you select **Update table.**

If you want to try out this new feature, try this preconfigured [template](https://docs.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0AoFkkLP2MB8kdFd4bEJ5VzR2RVdBQkVuSW91WE1zZkE&;mode=public&;pli=1) or by using your own data set. Currently, Pivot tables from Microsoft cannot be uploaded to Google docs. Google may add this feature in near future.
