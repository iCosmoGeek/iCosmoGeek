This now-famous _iPhone 4 Antenna Song_ was played before Steve Jobs took the stage to address the ‘reception issues’ at the iPhone 4 Press Conference.

Lyrics of the song, followed by the video:

> _“there’s an awful lot of hoopla  
> around the iphone 4 anttenna  
> when you grip it with the death grip  
> and you’re call slips away  
> the media loves a failure  
> in a string of success  
> the facts won’t ever matter  
> if they can make bigger messes  
> sure i can make it happen  
> but in terms of daily usage  
> i’ve yet to drop a call  
> so this whole damn thing is stupid  
> and you can call me a fanboy  
> i’ve been called worse things  
> but gizmodo just ridiculous  
> pulling their anti-apple strings  
> you bought a stolen prototype  
> get over it and move on  
> or hey even better  
> let’s all sing this song”_

This blog writer already updated that Apple is offering free bumpers (_aka cases_) to all their iPhone 4 users as a solution to antenna problems. No recall!
