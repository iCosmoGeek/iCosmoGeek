> _This is me creating a jam track with apple’s Garageband app for the ipad and then shredding a guitar solo over it! I am sorry about the bad video quality, but i could not find a way to record ipad’s screen in a fast framerate. Anyway i believe you will get the idea. Hope you enjoy!_

He created on a $5 piece of Apple software: Garageband \[[App Store](http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/garageband.html)\]. He used guitars, drums, and keyboard on iPad.

Impressive? Huh?
