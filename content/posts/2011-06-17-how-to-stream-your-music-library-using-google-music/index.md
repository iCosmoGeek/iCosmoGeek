Having to sync all your music between devices is a bit annoying stuff. Few days ago, Google [launched](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/05/google-io-2011-day-1-highlights-android_15.html) a new music service **Google Music** that lets you upload your personal music collection to the cloud from which you can play them from anywhere directly on computer and Android devices.

This service is now in beta mode and invitation based for the United States users only. I managed to get the invitation yesterday night and uploaded around 330 songs from my library. This article gives a sneak peak of this next generation cloud service.

If you carefully observe above screenshot, you can different set of buttons like **Previous song, Play, Next song, Shuffle songs, Repeat songs, Volume.**

**Pros:**

> You can also create new playlists and instant mixes.
> 
> One of the best desktop webapp – fast, easy to use and some cool extra features
> 
> Currently Free while in beta and you can upload up to 20,000 songs (_thats more than required!)_
> 
> Android app is also pretty good with some neat album art views and the ability to download songs for offline playback.

**Cons:**

> It is currently only available on Android devices – so iPhone lovers and other mobile devices are completely left out.
> 
> Not sure whether the service will be free once out of beta
