Apple has released an official statement a while ago on their new amazing iPhone ever yet – **iPhone 4S.** The company has sold over four million iPhone 4S in first three days after its launch on October 14. That’s around 1000 a minute and 16 a second!

I [managed](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/10/iphone-4s-unboxing-pictures.html) to get this amazing device on the first day of its launch and it just works!!

From [Apple](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111017005811/en/iPhone-4S-Weekend-Sales-Top-Million):

> _Apple® today announced it has sold over four million of its new iPhone® 4S, just three days after its launch on October 14. In addition, more than 25 million customers are already using iOS 5, the world’s most advanced mobile operating system, in the first five days of its release, and more than 20 million customers have signed up for iCloud®, a breakthrough set of free cloud services that automatically and wirelessly store your content in iCloud and push it to all your devices. iPhone 4S is available today in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK, and will be available in 22 more countries on October 28 and more than 70 countries by the end of the year._

This fast pacing track can surpass Microsoft’s Kinect sales of 8 million devices in first 60 days. Apple could pass this in first two weeks theoretically.

This huge success is most likely due to its availability on three major carriers AT&T, Verizon, Sprint; availability in 5 countries; and the product is just [amazing](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/10/iphone-4s-a5-dual-core-8-mp-camera.html)!
