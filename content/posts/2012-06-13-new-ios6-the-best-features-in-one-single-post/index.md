The new feature brain, iOS 6 of iPhone and iPad is about to release in this Fall and is lovelier with full of new features. It comes with over 200 features and is compatible  with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPod touch 4, iPad 2 and the new iPad. There is no support for first generation iPhone and first iPad.

With the availability of iOS 6 beta to developers, I am expecting to see lot more surface in the coming months. I managed to put all the best features in this one single post. Come back and check again for more updates.

**Maps**

Apple ditched Google Maps in iOS 6. In yesterday's keynote [announcement](http://icosmogeek.com/wwdc-keynote-summary-ios-6-news-apps-new-macs/), Apple kicked off with a Siri gimmick, she made fun of Google's Android code names, and also compared Samsung's new phone to a refrigerator.

The new Maps is vector based with visual and spoken turn by turn navigation, real time traffic updates.

**Siri -** Siri now understands more languages and is available on the new iPad. She can now open apps and you can also post updates to Facebook and Twitter.

**Facebook Integration -** You can now post directly to Facebook just like current Twitter integration. You can share photos from Camera app, location from Maps, links from Safari. Facebook contacts and birthdays are also stored directly into your OS.
