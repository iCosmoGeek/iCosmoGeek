Close on heels of [Google Instant](http://www.google.com/instant/), here comes [YouTube Instant](http://ytinstant.com/) and [Twitter Instant](http://content.manmohanjit.com/uploads/demos/twitter-instant/), possibly the fastest way to instantly search videos and Twitter right now.

**Youtube Instant** is the creation of [Feross Aboukhadijeh](http://www.feross.org/youtube-instant-media-frenzy/), a computer science student at Stanford University, who bet with his roommate (after the launch of Google Instant) and built a real-time YouTube search in 3 hours!
