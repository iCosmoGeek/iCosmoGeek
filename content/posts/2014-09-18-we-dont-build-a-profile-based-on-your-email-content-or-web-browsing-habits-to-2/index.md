“We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers,” Cook said, taking a clear dig at Google. “We don’t “monetize” the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you.” Cook closes by saying that he and Apple knows customer trust “doesn’t come easy” and that Apple will “work as hard as hard as we can to earn and keep it.”
