BREAKING: Microsoft cutting 18,000 jobs, 14% of company, in its largest layoffs ever.  
  
It’s the largest job reduction in the company’s history — a major move by new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella intended, in part, to streamline the way Microsoft develops products and runs its engineering teams.

With this in mind, we will begin to reduce the size of our overall workforce by up to 18,000 jobs in the next year. Of that total, our work toward synergies and strategic alignment on Nokia Devices and Services is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs, comprising both professional and factory workers. We are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions, and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months. It’s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas. My promise to you is that we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent......
