Macs have generally been the forerunner when it comes to computers and tablets, which is why so many people have purchased iMacs, Macbook Pros and iPads. And while these computers and these tablets have an array of great features, have a great support group, and will not become infected with a virus, some people simply cannot afford their hefty price tags. Rather than considering yourself unlucky to not own a Mac product, there are other options out there that can mimic the Macs—and they can do this with a much lower purchase price.

Instead of a Macbook Pro, get yourself a Dell XPS 15z.

Macbook Pros are known for their sleek and lightweight design, making them very attractive to many users. Insert the Dell XPS 15z, and you may think you're looking at twins. The XPS 15z is a very thin 15" laptop and it's powered by 2nd Gen Intel® Core™ processors. This computer also features a 500GB hard drive, and 6GB of RAM, as well as a GeForce 525M graphics processor. The XPS 15z has many functions that help improve battery life, and it also contains two 3.0 USB ports, a USB/eSATA combo port, HDMI outputs and a multi card reader. The base model of the XPS 15z has a resolution of 1366x768, but you have the option to upgrade to 1920x1080. But the best feature on the XPS 15z is that it started at less than $1000, unlike its Macbook Pro competitors. Instead of an iPad, get yourself a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.

Some people consider the iPad the only tablet worth owning, but while it has an array of great features, the iPad is not the only tablet on the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is lighter and comes with a bigger screen than the iPad 2. It also has both a back and a front camera, and its dual speakers are extremely powerful. The Galaxy Tab is an Android product, so users still have the capability to download apps and play games on their tablet. The keyboard responds quickly, transferring files between the Galaxy Tab and the computer is easy, and Android devices actually allow you to open PDFs—something that iPads do not do. All Kindle apps work on the Galaxy Tab, and some apps and software that iTunes charges for can be downloaded on the Galaxy Tab for free. And all Google services work wonderfully too. Though it may not have the fancy iPad name, the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 has plenty of features that make it its own great tablet, and some of these features cannot be found on an iPad. And a Galaxy Tab will cost you less than an iPad. So if you're shopping for a new computer or tablet and you don't have the money to afford a Mac product, rest assured that there are plenty of other options out there that will give you a great amount of features and benefits for your money.
