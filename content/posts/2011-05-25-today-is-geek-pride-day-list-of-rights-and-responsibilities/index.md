Do you know what today is? Its Geek Pride Day! Yay!!

Today was declared **Geek Pride Day** to commemorate the release of the first **Star Wars** film on May 25th, 1977.

But according to Wikipedia, this day wasn’t officially acknowledged until 2008/2009 when it started to grow mass appeal and grabbed the attention of bloggers locally in New York, others around the world, and then eventually the main stream media.

Geeks can be in any field – Computer Geek, Internet Geek, Academic Geek, Politics Geek, Pop Geek, Film Geek, Food Geek, etc.

Here is a fun **Geek Bill of Rights and Responsibilities** that was originally published in a Spanish website and also in Wikipedia:

**Rights:**

> _The right to be even geekier.  
> The right to not leave your house.  
> The right to not like football or any other sport.  
> The right to associate with other nerds.  
> The right to have few friends (or none at all).  
> The right to have as many geeky friends as you want.  
> The right to be out of style.  
> The right to show off your geekiness.  
> The right to take over the world._

**Responsibilities:**

> _Be a geek, no matter what.  
> Try to be nerdier than anyone else.  
> If there is a discussion about something geeky, you must give your opinion.  
> To save and protect all geeky material.  
> Do everything you can to show off geeky stuff as a "museum of geekiness."  
> Don't be a generalized geek. You must specialize in something.  
> Attend every nerdy movie on opening night and buy every geeky book before anyone else.  
> Wait in line on every opening night. If you can go in costume or at least with a related T-shirt, all the better.  
> Don’t waste your time on anything not related to geekdom.  
> Try to take over the world!_
