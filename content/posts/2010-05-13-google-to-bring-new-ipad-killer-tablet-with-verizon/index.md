Google seems to be working on a Tablet to rival Apple’s wonder tablet computer; the iPad.

However, to the most of us this shouldn’t come as a surprise as Google had previously shown interest in bringing Android and Chrome OS to the market on a tablet computer and even shared a video mock-up.

For now the details of the tablet are all under the hood but now with Microsoft Courier and HP Slate out of the scene, this is our only contender for the ‘iPad Killer’ but will it be?
