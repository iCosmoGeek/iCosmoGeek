For those of you who have been waiting for iPhone 4 unlock on 3.10.01 and 2.10.04 basebands, here is the official iPhone unlock statement from MuscleNerd of iPhone _**Dev-Team -**_

> Official iPhone unlock statement: no unlock will be released until after 4.2.5 or official 4.3 (whichever is last) is out

Now that we have CDMA version of iPhone (available from Feb 10), with completely different baseband OS from that of GSM, it will be interesting to see if the iPhone hacker team will take the challenge of unlocking the CDMA devices as well.  
  
Meanwhile, enjoy the post mentioning sneak peak details of iOS 4.3 [here](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/whats-new-in-ios-43.html).
