Sneak peak of the Announcement -

_“Today McAfee agreed to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Obviously this is big news for McAfee, big news for Intel Corporation, big news for our combined customers, and big news for both the security industry and the future of the Internet. It’s the company’s common belief that security is a fundamental component of modern computing, and the acquisition reflects its increasing relevance in a completely connected world.  The number of connected devices is expected to grow from 1 billion to 50 billion by 2020.  This explosive growth of Internet and IP-enabled devices (e.g. Internet enabled TV, IP addressable cars, ATM machines, medical devices) is fundamentally reshaping communication, collaboration and commerce opportunities for individuals, businesses and governments around the world.”_
