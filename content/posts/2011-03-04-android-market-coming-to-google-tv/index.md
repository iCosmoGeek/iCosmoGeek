**[Google TV](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/two-possible-ways-to-get-google-tv.html)** hasnâ€™t been that popular so far despite the fact that the platform has some interesting features. One of the things that I think could save the Google TV platform would be access to apps from the Android Market on the Google TV platform.

A new version of the Android Market for the Google TV platform is now officially noted to be coming soon and that announcement came directly from Ashish Arora, GM of Google TV products at Logitech yesterday.

Google, however, has launched its marketplace for Android apps both for its phone platform as well as its Chrome Web store via the Web. So far, however, Google TV has lacked a similar aspect.
