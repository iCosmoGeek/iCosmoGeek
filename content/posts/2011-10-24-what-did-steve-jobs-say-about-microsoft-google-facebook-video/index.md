In CBSNews’ _[60 Minutes](http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml)_ interview with the author Walter Isaacson, he explains on what Steve Jobs told him before his death for the biography. The author conducted more than 40 taped interviews with Steve.

One of the interesting parts in the segment about Steve’s thoughts on his digital rivals Microsoft, Google.

> **_“Bill \[Gates\] is basically unimaginative and has never invented anything, which is why I think he’s more comfortable now in philanthropy than technology. He just shamelessly ripped off other people’s ideas,” Jobs said._**

In addition to Microsoft's Bill Gates and Google's Larry Page, the tapes reveal what Jobs thought about Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.

> **_"You know we talk about social networks in the plural but I don't see anybody other than Facebook out there. It's just Facebook - they're dominating this. I admire Mark Zuckerberg. I only know him a little bit, but I admire him for not selling out. For wanting to make a company. I admire that a lot."_**

Meanwhile, I’ll work in collecting best excerpts of the book in news articles across the web.
