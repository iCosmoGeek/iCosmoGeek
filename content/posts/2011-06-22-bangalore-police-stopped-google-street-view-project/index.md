On 27 May, 2011, Google [announced](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/05/google-launches-street-view-for-india.html) that it will start capturing images using special equipment for their innovative Street View. This lets you explore places around the world through 360 degree level imagery. Google uses cars, trikes, snowmobile and more equipment to capture these interesting places and then turn photos into Street View.

Now, Bangalore Police Commissioner Jyotiprakash Mirji told a TV channel that the company will have to seek permission from the central government before it can go ahead. The company confirmed that it has received a letter from him on Street View and that it has stopped its cars from taking pictures of the city.

Google said -

> _“We are reviewing it and have stopped our cars until we have a chance to answer any questions on concerns that the police have,”_

And concerning privacy issues, Google apply cutting-edge and license plate burring technology to help ensure that passers-by and cars in the photographs can’t be identified.
