Though there are many rumours on the launch date and price, this innovative phone with stunning retina display, FaceTime is too late to launch in India. With already buzz around blogosphere about the next generation iPhone 5, India is in tail end of Apple’s product cycles. The same happened in the case of [iPad 2](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/03/apple-announces-ipad-2-thinner-lighter.html).

Bharti, which already sells earlier models of the iPhone, has added 2 million users to its 3G network, which was launched in January.
