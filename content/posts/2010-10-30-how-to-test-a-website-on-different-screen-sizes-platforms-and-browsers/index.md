The first part of this tutorial explains how to test a website at the screen size of different devices like iPhone, iPad, Tablets, Android phones etc.

Different mobile devices have different resolutions for their screen â€“ for example, [Apple](http://www.cosmogeek.info/search/label/Apple) iPad has 768 x 1024 or 1024 x 768px screen size in different mode and [Google](http://www.cosmogeek.info/search/label/Google) Nexus One has 480 x 800 screen pixel size. Now, if you want to see your website on these screen sizes, here is a website to resize any browser to some preset value at single click.

[resizeMyBrowser](http://www.resizemybrowser.com/) is a web service to resize the window size of browser to specified value. Once you will open the website, you can see 15 preset values for devices like iPhone 3G/3GS, iPad, Google Nexus One, iPhone 4G, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Normal Netbooks and Laptops etc. Just click on those links to get the resized browser for those pixel sizes.
