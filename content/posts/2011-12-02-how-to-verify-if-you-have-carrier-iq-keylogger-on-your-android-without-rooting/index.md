The latest buzz about [Carrier IQ](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/12/your-android-phone-is-recording.html) is all around tech and non-tech world. Yesterday, we learned [how to verify and remove](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/12/how-to-verify-and-remove-carrier-iq.html) Carrier IQ from your Android device. But, that method requires you to root your device.

Now, we learn how to detect about this spying software, but not yet remove, and no rooting of your Android device is required.

While this Carrier IQ crap develops, battle between OS developers and mobile carriers continues, a free app **Voodoo Carrier IQ Detector** lets you verify whether your Android device is infected or not. Unfortunately, it only verifies but do not remove. After installing, once you launch this app, if you see the detection score as 0 which means best, and anything above zero means Carrier IQ is present and you should seriously consider rooting your Android phone.

Unfortunately, Apple admitted that it included a copy of Carrier IQ in all devices up through iOS 5. This option is disabled on iOS 5; older versions may send back information. If you have an iOS 5 device, turning off “Diagnostics and Usage” option to “Don’t Send” appears to be enough under Settings > General > About > Diagnostics and Usage.

Android users may have to wait for now. As discussed earlier, you always have an option if your Android device is rooted. Just follow this [procedure](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/12/how-to-verify-and-remove-carrier-iq.html).
