The stock price was set at $38 each. Its estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut. Trading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the NASDAQ exchange. The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.
