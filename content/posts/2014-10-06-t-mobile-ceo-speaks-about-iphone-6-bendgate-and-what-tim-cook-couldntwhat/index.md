T-Mobile CEO speaks about iPhone 6 bendgate and what Tim Cook couldn't!  
  
  
“What the \*\*\*\* are you putting it in your pants and sitting on it for?” he asks.  
  
“You know what, those 9 people that sat on their phones, first of all they need jeans that fit them a little better, cause if your jeans are cutting your phone. What idiot \[tries to bend the iPhone 6\]? Give me a break. Take your laptop, you know, do handstands on it, throw it against the wall. That’s bull\*\*\*\*. This thing doesn’t f\*\*\*ing bend.”
