A new year is always the right time to make resolutions. I personally stopped making resolutions – because I wouldn’t stick to them![Smile](images/image%5B4%5D.png)![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_40bmzDo_mBs/TSQafVQR4EI/AAAAAAAABsg/yd-Bpaho0VE/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800 "image")

Some of Steve’s resolutions are shocking and/or surprising, while others suggest a playful CEO who enjoys pranking the likes of Mark Zuckerberg!

This is obviously [fake](http://scoopertino.com/steve-jobs-new-years-resolutions-found-on-starbucks-napkin/), but I had a good laugh from it so I wanted to share that with you.
