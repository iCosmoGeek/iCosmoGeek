Apple is remarkable and popular to its minute design tweaks and improvements in terms of graphics and calligraphy. Today, I noticed a weird text overlap on my **iPhone 4S** running **iOS 5**.

Before you watch the video to reproduce on your devices, here is the screenshot of the bug:

If you carefully observe above two screenshots, the **‘Battery Usage’** is overlapped with **‘Manage Storage’** and the iCloud description is also repeated twice in the first screenshot.

I managed to reproduce this UI bug in my **16 GB black iPhone 4S running iOS 5.0, W-Fi (Settings > Wi-Fi) and Cellular Data (Settings > General > Network > Cellular Data)** turned **OFF; iCloud** configured.

To reproduce this bug on your devices, go to **Usage (Settings > Usage).** While your iPhone calculating the storage of all the apps, scroll up your screen over and over until it displays all the usage. That’s it!

I’ve captured a short video of this UI bug:

Are you able to reproduce this bug in any of your other devices (either iPhone 4 or iPod touch) apart from iPhone 4S ?
