Did you install the latest **[Service Pack](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/02/remove-windows-7-sp1-backup-files-and.html)** Microsoft has released for **Windows 7** few days ago? If not, do it right away and patch your OS. A typical Service Pack 1 installation takes at least 30 to 60 minutes depending on your computer configuration and files.

Imagine you got to format your machine and do a fresh Windows 7 installation. At that time, you need to install this update (read SP1) over again. There should be an easier method where you can integrate the service pack right into your Operating System disc which saves your valuable time!
