🎉 I built and launched an AI-powered full-stack hobby project by "vibe coding" a few hours over the weekend. 🚀 — solo.

Just me, VS Code, and a few AI copilots — Claude Sonnet, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI models.

## ⚙️ What I Built

An AI-driven platform that:

• Generates engaging posts for LinkedIn, X, and Facebook  
• Publishes automatically across platforms  
• Turns full articles into short posts (zero AI cost)  
• Manages a reusable content library

## 🧠 How I Built It – "Vibe Coding"

⏱ Weeks of work → hours per feature

Instead of grinding through every detail, I built *in flow* — letting AI handle the heavy lifting while I focused on architecture and experience.

## 🧰 The Stack

• Backend: Python (FastAPI)  
• Frontend: Next.js 15 (TypeScript)  
• AI: OpenAI API+ Claude Sonnet  
• Infra: Azure + Vercel  
• DB: Supabase + Redis  

## 📊 The Numbers

✅ 15,000+ lines of code  
✅ 40+ API endpoints  

## 🎯 What I Learned

AI doesn't replace developers — it amplifies them.  
It clears the noise so you can focus on creativity and architecture.

## 🔮 What's Next

I'm evolving this into a multi-agentic AI system — where autonomous agents collaborate to design, code, test, and schedule content.

Current system is monolithic AI (one GPT call does everything). 

Next phase: Multi-Agent Architecture with Azure AI Foundry.

```
Main Orchestrator Agent
├── Content Generator Agent
│   └── Specializes in drafting engaging posts
├── Platform Optimizer Agent
│   └── Knows X vs LinkedIn best practices
├── Engagement Analyzer Agent
│   └── Predicts virality and suggests optimal timing
├── Compliance Validator Agent
│   └── Checks brand safety and tone consistency
└── Scheduler Agent
    └── Manages posting queue and auto-publish
```

Imagine a digital team working 24/7 on your strategy while you sleep.
