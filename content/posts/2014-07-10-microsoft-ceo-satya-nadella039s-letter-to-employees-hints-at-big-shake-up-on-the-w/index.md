Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's letter to employees hints at big shake-up on the way.  
  
This long email to all employees suggests the company could shift away from its recent focus on devices and services. Nadella confirmed the tech giant would focus on mobile and cloud technology, rather than its long focus on software for PCs.

Subject: Starting FY15 - Bold Ambition & Our Core  
  
Team,  
  
As we start FY15, I want to thank you for all of your contributions this past year. I'm proud of what we collectively achieved even as we drove significant changes in our business and organization. It's energizing to feel the momentum and enthusiasm building.  
The day I took on my new role I said that our industry does not respect tradition – it only respects innovation. I also said that in order to accelerate our innovation, we must rediscover our soul – our unique core. We must all understand and embrace what only Microsoft can contribute to the world and how we can once again change the world. I consider the job before us to be bolder and more ambitious than anything we have ever done.
