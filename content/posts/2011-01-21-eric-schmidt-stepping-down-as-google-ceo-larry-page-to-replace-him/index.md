Larry Page, who served as Google’s first CEO from 1998 to 2001 will take over as CEO. Schmidt will remain on as “Executive Chairman”, where he will focus on deals, partnerships, customers and broader business relations.

On a lighter note, Schmidt [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/ericschmidt/status/28196946376130560), “Day-to-day adult supervision no longer needed!”
