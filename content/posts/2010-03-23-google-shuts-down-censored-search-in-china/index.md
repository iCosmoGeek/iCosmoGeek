It’s a sad day for all Google users in China since the site’s search operations have been shutdown completely and Google.cn is now redirecting towards Google.com.hk  
_Here is an update from the official Google blog_:  
So earlier today we stopped censoring our search services—Google Search, Google News, and Google Images—on Google.cn. Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to [Google.com.hk](http://www.google.com.hk/), where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong. Users in Hong Kong will continue to receive their existing uncensored, traditional Chinese service, also from [Google.com.hk](http://www.google.com.hk/). Due to the increased load on our Hong Kong servers and the complicated nature of these changes, users may see some slowdown in service or find some products temporarily inaccessible as we switch everything over.
