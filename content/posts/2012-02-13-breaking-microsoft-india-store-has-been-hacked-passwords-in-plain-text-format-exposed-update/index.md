Well, this is huge! Microsoftâ€™s India online store [website](http://www.microsoftstore.co.in/) has been hacked and all user information which was stored in plain text format without any encryption has also been exposed. It looks like the hacker team got remote access to the whole web server.

The main reasons behind this hack are still unknown but from the homepage replaced information, its been predicted that a non well known hacker organization EvilShadow is behind all this invasion.
