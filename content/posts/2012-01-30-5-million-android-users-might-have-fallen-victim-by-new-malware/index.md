Here comes one more security flaw from official Android market. Things just keep on getting worse if you are using an Android device. We have seen many [instances](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/12/your-android-phone-is-recording.html) in the past related to Android security and now a new potential security has been identified by Symantec claiming that 13 applications from three developers could be collecting data and performing malicious activities without user knowledge.

Symantec also analyzed that the result could be more than five million devices could potentially running those apps. This could be the biggest security risk till date.

Following are the apps that have been identified by Symantec as of today -

- Counter Elite Force
- Counter Strike Ground Force
- CounterStrike Hit Enemy
- Heart Live Wallpaper
- Hit Counter Terrorist
- Stripper Touch girl
- Balloon Game
- Deal & Be Millionaire
- Wild Man
- Pretty women lingerie puzzle
- Sexy Girls Photo Game
- Sexy Girls Puzzle
- Sexy Women Puzzle

From [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/connect/fr/blogs/androidcounterclank-found-official-android-market) -

> _“Symantec has identified multiple publisher IDs on the Android Market that are being used to push out **Android.Counterclank**. This is a minor modification of Android.Tonclank, a bot-like threat that can receive commands to carry out certain actions, as well as steal information from the device. For each of these malicious applications, the malicious code has been grafted on to the main application in a package called “apperhand”. When the package is executed, a service with the same name may be seen running on a compromised device. Another sign of an infection is the presence of the Search icon above on the home screen.”_

If you downloaded any one of the above apps, I suggest taking removing them immediately.
