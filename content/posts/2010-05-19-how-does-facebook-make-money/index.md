Facebook revenues reached $500 million in 2009, up from $300 million in 2008, according to Fortune editor David Kirkpatrick, who cites "well-informed sources" in his upcoming book, The Facebook Effect.

Facebook expects revenues to reach $800 million in 2010.

Where did 2009's $500 million come from?

Self-service ads, which appear on the right side of the screen on Facebook, accounted for about $250 million to $300 million. They look like this:

As a part of a 2007 ad deal, Microsoft sells some ads on Facebook. It's payment for the privilege reached $50 million in 2009.

Finally, Facebook Gifts and other virtual goods account for between $30 million and $50 million in 2009.

These figures are fairly consistent with Inside Facebook's March 2010 report.
