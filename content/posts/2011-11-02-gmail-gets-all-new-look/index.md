Before you try out this new look, here are some major enhancements -

> **Streamlined conversations:** You will now be able to see pictures for your contacts
> 
> **Elastic density**: Click the wrench button to change the display density
> 
> **New HD themes**
> 
> **Smarter navigation**
> 
> **Better search**

All Gmail users should not get this option to change into new look. Did you like it?
