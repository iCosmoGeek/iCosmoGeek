Currently there is no way to mount your Amazon Cloud Drive to Windows or Mac. Also there are no mobile application to access Amazon Cloud Drive but we know that those apps and Amazon Cloud APIs are coming very soon.

Amazon has also launched **The Cloud Player** that works on PCs, Macs and Android devices. So if you have all your music libraries uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Drive, you can access it from anywhere in the world as long as you have internet connection and play them directly!

Interestingly, Amazon also told that they do not need a license to store music in Cloud Drive because "the functionality of saving MP3s to Cloud Drive is the same as if a customer were to save their music to an external hard drive or even iTunes.” This riles music industry.
