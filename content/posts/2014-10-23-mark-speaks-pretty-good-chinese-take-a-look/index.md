On Wednesday I did my first ever public Q&A in Chinese at Tsinghua University in Beijing!We discussed connecting the world, [Internet.org](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FInternet.org%2F&h=pAQHD_b71&s=1), innovation and the early days of Facebook. Earlier this week I joined the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management Advisory Board. Tsinghua is an amazing center of learning and research, and it has been inspiring to be with so many talented future Chinese leaders.
