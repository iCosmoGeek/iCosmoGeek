Just like [Gevey SIM](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/06/gevey-sim-only-working-method-to-unlock.html) which requires the user to actually place the SIM interposer between the network’s SIM card, a new Chinese development **ChinaSnow** claims that they have successfully unlocked iPhone 4S (1.0.11, 1.0.13, 1.014) and also iPhone 4 (1.59.00, 2.10.04, 3.10.01, 4.10.01) on the latest iOS 5.0, iOS 5.0.1 versions.

This is really great news for all those who are waiting for several months, especially iPhone 4 owners who are using them as music devices.

Currently displaying as out of stock, for $84.95, this seems to be heavily priced from the Beijing store. Here is the list of features as displayed on the [website](http://www.beijingiphonerepair.com/store/#ecwid:category=807125&mode=product&product=9381105):

> _No jailbreak required, insert and go!  
> No need to dial 112 (after the first time initialization)  
> Supports 3G, EDGE, MMS, Facetime  
> Supports iPhone 4S baseband 1.0.11, 1.0.13 and 1.0.14. 
> Supports iPhone 4 baseband 1.59.00, 2.10.04, 3.10.01, 4.10.01 but NOT 4.11.08  
> No hardware alteration or modification required – will not affect your warranty  
> Robust and sturdy steel custom SIM tray  
> Unlocks ALL worldwide networks  
> Uses high performance original F981 chip for ultra-low voltage operation_

I would encourage users to place order under extreme caution, as nobody tested this new interposer as demonstrated in the video below. But, as there are no signs on UltraSn0w updates for left over firmware from Dev team, this could be a real bet.
