Today, Google announced that it is going to increase Android app size limit from 50 MB to 4 GB. Until now, Android apps have been limited to a maximum size of 50 MB. Even though this works for most apps, there are instances where developers felt trouble uploading HD and 3D apps especially games which require more resources.

According to official blog [post](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/03/android-apps-break-50mb-barrier.html), Application APK size remains limited to 50 MB, however, developers can now include two 2 GB expansion stores which are stored in shared storage on the client device.
