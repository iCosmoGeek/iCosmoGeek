Love my new creative Facebook [Profile](http://www.facebook.com/k.avinash) Page? I managed to maximize the new [Facebook design](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/12/how-to-get-new-facebook-profile.html) released officially last week in a rather innovative and original way!  
  
[![image](images/profile-pic.jpg)- Create a new photo album, then upload the other images in the order of their filenames.
- Tag yourself in all 5 photos, starting with "image5.jpg" and ending with "image1.jpg."
- Hide any tagged photos you do not wish to display on your profile. That's it!
Try out combinations and post your innovative profile page links in the comments section below or on](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_40bmzDo_mBs/TQxymGmXDvI/AAAAAAAABrU/JyKOV849Hss/s1600-h/image%5B3%5D.png) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cosmoGeek) fan page or on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/k_avinash). Share this post using social network buttons at the beginning of the post and let your friends change their Facebook profile pages using innovative ideas.
