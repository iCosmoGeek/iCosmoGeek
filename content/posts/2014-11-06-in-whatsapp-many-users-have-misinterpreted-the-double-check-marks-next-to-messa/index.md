In WhatsApp, many users have misinterpreted the double check marks next to messages to indicate that a message has been looked at, as so may other platforms offer the feature, but that’s not the case.  
  
In reality, the double check marks simply mean a message has been received by the other user (the single check only tells you the message reached WhatsApp’s servers).  
  
A new feature, blue coloring adds a third layer of information, will now light up its double-check marks blue when a message has been read.  
  
You should receive this update soon!
