Apple unveiled a new MacBook today that is its thinnest, lightest portable (2 pounds) computer yet. The device features a 12-inch retina display, with a .88 millimeter panel – the thinnest the company has ever made. It’s powered by an Intel Core M processor with speeds up to 1.3 GHz, and Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.9 GHz. In order to cut down on the device’s size even further, Apple eliminated all of the fans.
