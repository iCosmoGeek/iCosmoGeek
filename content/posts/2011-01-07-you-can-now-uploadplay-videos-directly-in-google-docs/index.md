Google has launched a new feature in Google Docs where you can upload video files and play it directly in the browser.

Once you've uploaded your video to Google Docs, you can watch it with the Google Docs video player. Simply click the file from your Documents List, and the player opens in a new page.

Google now supports common video format files such as .MPEG4, 3GPP and MOV files - (h264 and mpeg4 video codecs and AAC audio codec), AVI, .WMV, .FLV.

Once youâ€™ve uploaded a new video, it takes some time to process to play (and as well as some videos uploaded earlier last year), so they might not be immediately available for viewing.
