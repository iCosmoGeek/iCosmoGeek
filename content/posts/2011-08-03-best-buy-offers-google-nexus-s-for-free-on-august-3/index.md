This Android based phone doesn’t have a dual core processor and doesn’t feature a 3D display, no HDMI port but it is the best Android phone in the market.

With speculations coming out for Nexus 3 later this year by Christmas, I recommend readers to consider before purchasing this phone. If you still desperate to buy this Android phone, the deal is live right now at [http://bestbuy.com/mobile](http://bestbuy.com/mobile "http://bestbuy.com/mobile").
