And one more thing… Steve Jobs used his classic line yesterday to announce the new MacBook Air, a refresh of their ultrathin computer with the addition of an 11.6-inch smaller edition at [Apple's](http://www.cosmogeek.info/search/label/Apple) Cupertino headquarters in a press event.

The updated design is the first major refresh in the MacBook Air’s two and half year life. The casing is now .68 at it’s thickest part and .11 at the very end. The 13-inch’s battery life is now seven hours rather than five hours on the older model even when graded on a more stringent scale. The smaller brother is five hours. Both models have a 30 day standby time.

The flash storage chip is right on the board along side an 802.11n chip, Core 2 Duo CPU, and everything else. Full Tech Specs can be found in the [product page](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html).
