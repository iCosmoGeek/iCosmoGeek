The legendary passion of Apple’s cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs made a surprising presentation of Apple’s new campus at a Cupertino City Council meeting. In addition to making the world’s best computers, mobile phones and tablets, he also wants to build the world’s best office for his company.

He’s not calling it as iMothership, this 150 acre site previously owned by HP, will be enormous architectural achievement if Jobs has his own way.

Steve says – “We’ve hired some of the best architects in the world. We’ve come up with a design that puts 12,000 people in one building. That may sound rather odd – 12,000 people in one building. But we have seen office parks with lots of buildings that get pretty boring very fast. So we’d like to do something better than that.”

In addition, he adds – “Our people use computers all day and if the power goes out on the grid we will have to send everybody home. So we have to have backup power in place in the event of brownouts and stuff. I think we will make our energy centre the primary source of power and use the grid as backup. We think that makes more sense. We can generate power with natural gas and other ways that can be cleaner and cheaper.”

Apple plan to break ground next year and to move in by 2015.
