Apple has just unveiled some statistics that suggest iPad is definitely the people favorite gadget.

The Cupertinos have managed to sell more than 1 million iPad and that too in less than a month, in 28 days to be precise. iPad besides being larger in size to iPhone, has also proved to have a larger fan following since the iPhone reached the same landmark after 74 days of its launch.

Just remind yourself of this fact – the iPad is currently available for US folks only and still has managed to reach this milestone. This says a lot doesn’t it. Here’s how the influential Steve Jobs described it

> One million iPads in 28 days—that’s less than half of the 74 days it took to achieve this milestone with iPhone. Demand continues to exceed supply and we’re working hard to get this magical product into the hands of even more customers.

The other notable points include the number of download apps surpassing the 12 million count and the impressive count of over 1.5 million ebooks being downloaded from the extremely gorgeous iBookstore.
