Floppy disks, trackballs, serial ports, dial-up modems... All gone. Now it's time to kill the mouse.

Apple unveiled the new Magic Trackpad. Essentially, it’s a larger version of the trackpads that ship with each MacBook and MacBook Pro. But it’s a stand-alone product, meant to be used with desktop computers. It uses the same Multi-Touch technology you love on the MacBook Pro. And it supports a full set of gestures, giving you a whole new way to control and interact with what’s on your screen. Swiping through pages online feels just like flipping through pages in a book or magazine. And inertial scrolling makes moving up and down a page more natural than ever.

Magic Trackpad works using Bluetooth technology, so you don’t have to deal with an annoying cable that dictates where you place it.
