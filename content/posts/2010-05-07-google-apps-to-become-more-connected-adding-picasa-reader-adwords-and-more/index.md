I love that my Gmail account can connect to iGoogle, YouTube, Blogger, Picasa, and other products in the Google family, making the transition between applications seamless and easy.

Google is now [planning](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/05/more-google-applications-coming-for.html) to bring this interconnectivity to Google Apps. Google says 9 of the top 20 requests from Apps customers are for their accounts to work with more services from Google. Currently, Apps works with Gmail, Docs, Chat, Groups, Video and Calendar. Later this year, Google will roll out functionality with Apps for Picasa, Google Reader, AdWords, News, Finance, and other products. Users won't need to switch between their personal and work account to interact with these products from within the Apps interface.
