Its not a joke! Yahoo! is all set to launch a new browser tonight at 9PM PT. The new browser is called as Axis.

Yahoo describes [Axis](http://axis.yahoo.com/) as “a new mobile and desktop browsing search experience.” There are two parts to Axis: a browser extension and a standalone iOS app. Yahoo offers versions of the Axis extension for Safari, Chrome, and Firefox (along with Internet Explorer 9 for Windows); the iOS app is universal.

And according to [LAUNCH](http://www.launch.co/blog/yahoo-to-launch-chrome-killer-tonight.html), the company is set to release the desktop version tonight while the extension and iOS apps are already live.

> _Yahoo! Axis is a new browser that redefines what it means to search and browse- enabling a seamless search experience on your iPhone, iPad, and even your desktop. Here are some highlights of how Yahoo! Axis brings search to life in a whole new way_

From the following demo, the browser looks like it takes Google’s autocomplete to a whole new level by bringing up pages on the right hand side as you search for them.

Will it be a disaster or a Google Chrome killer?
