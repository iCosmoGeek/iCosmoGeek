According to [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-just-gave-every-yahoo-employee-an-iphone-5-2012-9), Yahoo employees have the option of choosing the phones from Apple, Samsung, Nokia and HTC. The list of smartphones include iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC One X, HTC EVO 4G LTE, or Nokia Lumia 920. These are the top phones on the market today and they will be replacing the BlackBerries that Yahoo employees were given up until this point.

Recently, according to [GeekWire](http://www.geekwire.com/2012/microsoft-employees-surface-tablets-work-pcs-windows-phone-8/), Microsoft employees are also getting free Surface tablets and Windows Phone 8 devices. These kind of benefits will certainly boost morale among employees with motivated workforce.

Below is the memo. Marissa was famous for her use of Apple’s iPhone, even within the walls of Google. Clearly, Yahoo will be buying lot of iPhone 5 devices via this fantastic program.

> _We have a very exciting update to share with you today – we are announcing  Yahoo!

> 
> _Moving forward, we’ll offer you a choice of devices as well as provide monthly plans for the data and phone._
