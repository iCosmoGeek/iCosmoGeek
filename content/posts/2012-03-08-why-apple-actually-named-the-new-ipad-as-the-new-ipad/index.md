Finally, Apple released its next iPad few hours ago. Before Apple’s event today, there were number of speculations that this ‘Resolutionary’ (_that’s what Apple is calling it on its official_ [_website_](http://www.apple.com/ipad/))  device is called as ‘iPad 3’ or ‘iPad HD’. But, Apple just named this new product as just ‘**The new iPad’**. Perfect!

This naming convention makes sense if you think for long term. Just think about in future, does iPhone 13 or iPad 16 makes sense to you? This also makes sense if you think about the iPhone series. The current iPhone 4S is actually the fifth generation iPhone device, and the next iPhone series is the sixth generation and Apple may call it as iPhone 5. Err, may be or completely not. Hope Apple call the next iPhone just ‘iPhone’, instead of iPhone 5. This is just similar to MacBooks, iMacs or Apple TVs.

Now, to summarize today’s Apple event, the Cupertino introduced tow new major products, along with new iOS update and software.

**iOS 5.1 is now available for download –** The major updates in this release include -
