Few days ago, HP started selling its **Touchpads** for $99 which was a huge flop product in the tablet world. This drastic price decrease is to cut down its manufacturing losses. Now, the company is also putting down its webOS to the open source community and cuts its losses.

The company also confirmed that it would not build any new webOS hardware for the time being, though it would actively develop and support the operating system.

**Do you think tablets will survive in this Apple ruling iPad world?**
