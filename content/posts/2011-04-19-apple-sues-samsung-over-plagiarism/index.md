The smartphone industry is [again](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/apple-sues-motorola-over-multi-touch.html) on patent issues. Nokia, Apple, Microsoft, Motorola  - all seems to be currently in litigation.

Have you noticed **[Samsung’s Galaxy](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/apple-sues-motorola-over-multi-touch.html)** line of products? Does they look an awful lot like iDevices \[iPhone, iPod Touch\]. Apple think so.

Apple filed a trademark infringement suit against Samsung last Friday with a U.S. District Court in North California. Apple’s court filing is filled with examples of the copycatting, ranging from product design to user interface. The suit mentions Apple patents from 2009 and 2010 that explain the iPhone’s physical design and various app icon trademarks.

> _“It’s no coincidence that Samsung’s latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging. This kind of blatant copying is wrong, and we need to protect Apple’s intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.”_

Other interesting to be mentioned here is that Samsung manufactures Apple’s A4 and A5 chips as well as LCD displays, flash memory and other parts.

Previously, Apple sued HTC / Nokia, HTC counter-sued, then Microsoft sued Motorola, then Motorola sued Apple and now Apple has counter sued Motorola. Check out an interesting chart [here](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/apple-sues-motorola-over-multi-touch.html).
