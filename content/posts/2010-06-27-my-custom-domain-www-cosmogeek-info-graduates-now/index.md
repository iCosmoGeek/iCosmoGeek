It's going to be one of those crazy-busy-full-of-wonderful months, I predict. ;) I'm so excited to share with you some new features to my blog ([http://avinashkblog.blogspot.com)](http://avinashkblog.blogspot.com)). This blog is at its peak in just 100 days and its an honor and I am so excited to put even more effort and love into this blog. Most of you know that I have purchased a custom domain last week and now I am so excited to graduate it to public - **[www.cosmoGeek.info](http://cosmogeek.info/)**.

I have re-directed my blog to this new URL (and the other way) and added/removed some of the buttons on the homepage. You can now easily keep up to date via various social networking media (RSS, Twitter, Facebook Page, Email).

Donâ€™t forget to **Like** ['cosmoGeek'](http://www.facebook.com/pages/cosmoGeek/132336730123446?ref=sgm) page on Facebook.

Comment in the blog or Email me at [avinashk@cosmogeek.info](mailto:avinashk@cosmogeek.info) for any suggestions.
