Superstitious hotels skip to over number 13 to avoid bad luck. Microsoft has decided to take a similar tack with its new Windows version, which it has dubbed Windows 10. Yes, there is no Windows 9. 
  
"We want all these Windows 7 users to have the sentiment that yesterday they were driving a first-generation Prius, and now with Windows 10 it's like a Tesla," - Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said at today's event.  
  
New features - The old Start Menu, Multiple Desktops, New Task View, etc.
