You must have read this [shocking news](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/12/your-android-phone-is-recording.html) about Carrier IQ software already. This piece of software logs texts, key taps, calls, emails, strokes, etc. without your knowledge. Here is how to verify and remove Carrier IQ on your Android device.

Trevor Eckhart, the same security researcher who actually discovered Carrier IQ’s fishy activities now posted an .APK with name **Logging Checker.** This software checks logging activity on your phone and lets you know where the logging data is going to. Additionally, it can also look for Google and HTC usage logs, Dropbox logs, etc.  
There are two versions of this logging checker – free and paid. The paid version guides you to remove Carrier IQ activity. Before installing, you need to ensure that your phone is rooted and ‘Unknown sources’ option is enabled from Settings > Applications.  
Download Logging Checker from official xda-developers thread [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=17612559&postcount=110).  
Download Logging Checker Pro from Android market [here](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.treve.loggingkey).
