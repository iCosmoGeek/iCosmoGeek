Facebook recently rolled out the new Photo Viewer to everyone where you can browse more photos faster without having to lose your place in Facebook. Instead, the photo opens in the center of your screen, and you close it when you're done. There's no need to go back and forth between pages or reload the page.

A new light box (the dark frame around your pictures) makes viewing photos a richer experience.

Well, this new photo viewer is not exactly all of us appreciate. If you want to view your photos in the good old classic way â€“ simply hit refresh or F5 on your keyboard. This will refresh the current Facebook page and the photo will display on its own page without the light box effect.

Is this a bug from Facebook or a feature? Whatever, enjoy it while you still can.
