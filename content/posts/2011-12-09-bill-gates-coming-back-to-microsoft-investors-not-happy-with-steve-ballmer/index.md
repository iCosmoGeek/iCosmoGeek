According to a [report](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/08/bill-gates-comeback/) on CNN Money, the company’s stock price has been a thorn in Steve Ballmer’s side for a decade. At the end of 1999, in Bill Gates period, shares were at almost $60. When Steve Ballmer took over in 2000, the share price dropped to $25.

> **_“"There’s a lot of frustration among investors with Steve Ballmer," added Ed Maguire of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. "Some is merited, some may not be. But there’s certainly a perception that Ballmer is responsible for the under-performance of the stock."_**

A return of the founder would undoubtedly boost morale among investors. Do you agree?
