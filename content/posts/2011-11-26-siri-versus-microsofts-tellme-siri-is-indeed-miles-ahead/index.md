Now that everybody are excited about Apple’s new **Siri** feature, Microsoft have been talking a lot over the past couple of days about the not so popular feature in Windows Phone 7 known as **Microsoft Tellme.**

The research office from Microsoft told Forbes recently that Microsoft has had similar technology on its Windows Phone platform for more than a year!

According to the [interview](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/11/23/microsofts-craig-mundie-on-siri-been-there-done-that-video/):

> **_“People are infatuated with Apple announcing it. It’s good marketing, but at least as the technological capability you could argue that Microsoft has had a similar capability in Windows Phones for more than a year, since Windows Phone 7 was introduced.”_**

There are lot of things Microsoft’s Tellme can’t do that Siri can. Forget about Siri’s ability to interact in normal everyday language with user or other apps, Microsoft’s [Tellme](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/tellme/) is not up to basic expectations. It is miles ahead of both Android and Windows Phone offerings.

Can’t believe? [TechAu](http://www.techau.tv/blog/microsoft-tellme-is-not-the-same-as-siri-video/) has put a video demonstration comparing both these voice assistants. Watch out:
