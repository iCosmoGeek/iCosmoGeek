Two months ago in January, the leading social networking site **Facebook** introduced [two new measures](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/facebook-introduced-social-captchas-and.html) to gripe up security - a secured connection and Social Authentication. One of the important step to make it easier to manage the security is the **HTTPS** option even while browsing.

Today, the micro blogging site **Twitter** finally [added](http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/making-twitter-more-secure-https.html) optional permanent HTTPS setting.

Using HTTPS for your Internet services is particularly important when using them over unsecured Wi-Fi connections.

To turn on HTTPS, go to [your settings](https://twitter.com/settings/account) and check the box next to “Always use HTTPS,” which is at the bottom of the page. This will improve the security of your account and better protect your information if you’re using Twitter over an unsecured Internet connection, like a public Wi-Fi network, where someone may be able to eavesdrop on your site activity.
