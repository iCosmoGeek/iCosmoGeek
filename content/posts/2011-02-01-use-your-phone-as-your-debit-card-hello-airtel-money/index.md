Airtel has launched a mobile wallet service called **Airtel Money** which is effectively a debit card with a limit of Rs 5,000. It has launched a service in Gurgaon which enables mobile payments. The subscriber needs to deposit money in his mobile account (similar to a bank account), and can then transfer money to the shopkeeper's ‘mwallet’ by sending an SMS.

Retailers need a phone connection and card reader to process credit card payments; while in case of Airtelmoney both the customer and the shopkeeper must have Airtel connections.
