The [rumors](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/02/nokia-to-announce-partnership-with.html) are true now. Nokia confirms Microsoft partnership making **[Windows Phone 7](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/10/microsoft-officially-unveiled-windows.html)** as the operating system of choice moving forward.

Nokia and Microsoft today announced plans to form a broad strategic partnership that would use their complementary strengths and expertise to create a new global mobile ecosystem.

In an open [letter](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2011/02/11/open-letter-from-ceo-stephen-elop-nokia-and-ceo-steve-ballmer-microsoft.aspx) from CEO Stephen Elop, Nokia and CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft – the Finnish handset maker will "contribute its expertise on hardware design, language support, and help bring Windows Phone to a larger range of price points, market segments and geographies".

Microsoft reportedly offered Nokia [hundreds of millions of dollars](http://blogs.computerworld.com/17800/google_and_microsoft_offer_nokia_hundreds_of_millions_to_abandon_meego_symbian) to make that switch and here’s the summary:

> Nokia will adopt Windows Phone as its primary smartphone strategy, innovating on top of the platform in areas such as imaging, where Nokia is a market leader.
> 
> Bing will power Nokia’s search services across Nokia devices and services, giving customers access to Bing’s next generation search capabilities.  Microsoft adCenter will provide search advertising services on Nokia’s line of devices and services.
> 
> Nokia Maps will be a core part of Microsoft’s mapping services. For example, Maps would be integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine and AdCenter advertising platform to form a unique local search and advertising experience.
