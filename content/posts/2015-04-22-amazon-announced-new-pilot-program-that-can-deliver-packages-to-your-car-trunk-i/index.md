Amazon announced new pilot program that can deliver packages to your car trunk if you live in Munich, Germany and drive Audi!  
  
  
How it works: A customer places an order and, during checkout, indicates the approximate location of his or her car during the desired delivery window. The driver is given a temporary, one-time digital access code to keylessly unlock the trunk (but not the rest of the car), puts the package in the trunk, and the vehicle is re-locked with the order inside.
