Microsoft has given a demonstration of their next generation operating system calling **Windows 8.** It appears to be a complete revamp of the Windows interface, designed around a tile system like that of Windows Phone 7, and focused on being equally accessible via touchscreen interface or mouse and keyboard.

Earlier, we saw many posts related to [Windows 8](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/03/windows-8-can-be-installed-in-8-minutes.html) in this blog, detailing leak plans, 8 minutes of installation and restoration, etc.

The first thing of note to come out of the interview is Windows 8′s new Start screen which bears more than a passing resemblance to Windows Phone 7′s tiles. While not quite WP7′s Metro UI, the similarities are certainly there, with apps being represented by large tiled icons, perfect for stabbing at with a finger.

Other features include Store icon, IE 10, full touch browsing, etc.

According to the official [press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx), here are a few aspects of the new interface -

> _Fast launching of apps from a tile-based Start screen, which replaces the Windows Start menu with a customizable, scalable full-screen view of apps.  
> _
> 
> _• Live tiles with notifications, showing always up-to-date information from your apps.  
> _
> 
> _• Fluid, natural switching between running apps.  
> _
> 
> _• Convenient ability to snap and resize an app to the side of the screen, so you can really multitask using the capabilities of Windows.  
> _
> 
> _• Web-connected and Web-powered apps built using HTML5 and JavaScript that have access to the full power of the PC.  
> _
> 
> _• Fully touch-optimized browsing, with all the power of hardware-accelerated Internet Explorer 10_
