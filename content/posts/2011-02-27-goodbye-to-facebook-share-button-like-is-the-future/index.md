Say Goodbye to the Facebook ‘Share’ button, because the new functionality of ‘Like’ button is taking it over. Facebook is rolling out new functionality changes to the ‘Like’ button.

Facebook is slowly rolling the update for Like button and has stopped developing the Share button. The company will continue to support the Share button but Like is the “recommended solution moving forward.”

Currently, hitting just the ‘Like’ button on any site is not just working just like ‘Share’ button does. The new like button functionality is only showing up the users’ profile but not in the news feed unlike ‘Share’ button functionality. Hope, Facebook will add this update too.

Do you ‘like’ the new button?
