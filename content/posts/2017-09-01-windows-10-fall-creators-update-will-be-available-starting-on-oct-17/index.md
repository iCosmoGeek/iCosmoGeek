Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will be available starting on Oct. 17, along with the first Windows Mixed Reality headsets from third-party hardware makers, but no timeline feature. The new version will include revamped Windows Inking technology, better OneDrive integration to access files on demand, security upgrades, a new Game Mode that provides more processing power for video games, and a new feature in the Windows Photos app called Story Remix for combining photos, videos, 3D technology and ink to tell stories and annotate video.
