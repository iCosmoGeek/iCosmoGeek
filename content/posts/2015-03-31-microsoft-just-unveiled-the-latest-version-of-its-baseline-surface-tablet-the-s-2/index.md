Microsoft just unveiled the latest version of its baseline Surface tablet, the Surface 3 â€” switching to an Intel Atom processor, and leaving behind the ARM-based processors that powered the first two versions. The change means that the new tablet runs a full version of Windows 8.1 and traditional Windows apps, not the Windows RT operating system, which was limited to Modern UI apps.  
  
The Surface 3, starting at $499, comes with a 10.8 inch screen, slightly smaller than the 12-inch Surface Pro 3 introduced by Microsoft last year.  
  
It comes in 64 GB and 128 GB models, and 4G LTE versions of the device are listed as coming in June.
