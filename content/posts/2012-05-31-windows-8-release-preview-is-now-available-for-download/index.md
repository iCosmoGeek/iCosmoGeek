Windows 8 Release Preview which was originally planned for the first week of June  is now available for download. This is not the final version and I would recommend only tech enthusiasts to try out on their personal computers.

Release Preview is the third release as part of testing process for Windows 8. The first version which was released back in September last year was called as Developer Preview and the second version was branded as Consumer Preview which was released in late February, 2012. Microsoft started calling new naming conventions against traditional beta, beta 1 or release candidate versions.

Compared to the Consumer Preview, this new version will include integrated Adobe Flash, greater customization of the Start screen, improved multimonitor usability, and many more features. This release preview could be the last version that will be offered for free to the public before the Redmond giant finalized the Release To Manufacturing (RTM) and Retail versions.

Earlier, Microsoft [announced](http://icosmogeek.com/microsoft-announced-windows-8-editions-windows-8-windows-8-pro-windows-rt/) that there will only be three editions - Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT. There were also rumors that Microsoft may offer retail consumers who already own Windows 7 for just $15 upgrade to Windows 8. We will have to wait for the final release which is expected around August - October timeframe.

Meanwhile, download the release preview from the following official links and let us know in the comments section how well in goes in terms of installation or usability.
