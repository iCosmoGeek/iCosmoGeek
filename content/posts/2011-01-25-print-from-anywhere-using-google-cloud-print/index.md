The future looks great on paper! Cloud is now becoming reality. You can now print from anywhere using Google Cloud Print.  
Google blew the lid off of Chrome OS by introducing Google Cloud Print Beta. Google Cloud Print makes printing more intuitive, accessible and useful, by allowing you to print to your printers from Google Cloud Print enabled apps on any computer or smart phone.  
By connecting your printer with the Google Cloud you will be able to print to your printer from any computer or smart phone, regardless of where you are. Just activate the Google Cloud Print connector in Google Chrome and your printer will automatically be available to you from Google Cloud Print enabled web and mobile apps.
