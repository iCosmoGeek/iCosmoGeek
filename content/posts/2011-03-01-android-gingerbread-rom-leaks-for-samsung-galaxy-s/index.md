Samsung Galaxy S owners who frequently visit the Galaxy S sub-forum on XDA developers forum know that firmware leaks are a pretty common thing. Up until now, we have only had firmware leaks based on Android 2.2 or 2.2.1.

Today, an **Android 2.3.2 Gingerbread** based firmware for the **Galaxy S** has leaked on the Internet. Samsung proprietary TouchWIZ UI (v3.0) also runs on top of it. The new firmware (XWJV1) is not an official one and is an early beta firmware.

Samsung Germany has [confirmed](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/02/samsung-confirmed-gingerbread-update.html) that **Galaxy S** will get an Android 2.3 **Gingerbread** update in March 2011 (India and other countriesâ€™ carrier specific variants will probably have to wait a long time).

Since, this is a beta firmware, bugs and crashes are common and follow [this](http://www.samfirmware.com/apps/blog/show/6282349-android-2-3-2-leaks-for-galaxy-s-) procedure at your own risk.
