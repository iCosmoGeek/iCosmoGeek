If you are one of those Apple fan boys who eagerly wait and purchase new devices by standing in those long lines or even if you are not an Apple fan but waiting to purchase a killer smartphone, you should really wait for this biggie! And if you already own iPhone 4S which is almost one year old device, now is the time to sell it. The question everyone asks, where to sell your iPhone 4S for good deal?
