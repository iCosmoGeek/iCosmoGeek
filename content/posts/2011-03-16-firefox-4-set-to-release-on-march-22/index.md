Mozilla has set a release date for the next iteration of its popular open-source browser **Firefox 4** on **March 22,** unless there is a show-stopping bug.

Last week, the company made the Release Candidate build available which includes an updated interface for all platforms that’s sleeker and easier to use.

The open source outfit's Damon Sicore [confirmed](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning/browse_thread/thread/18a347956e4693eb/3d90f3fc792f5946?show_docid=3d90f3fc792f5946) yesterday that the Release Candidate build of Firefox 4 that Mozilla pushed out last week is likely to be the final test version of the browser.

> _"Firefox 4 RC1 has received a very warm welcome; it's time to make a decision to ship," wrote Sicore._
> 
> _"As of now, there are no known issues that would stop us from shipping RC1 as final. At the conclusion of our regular 11:30AM triage session on Wednesday, March 16th, release drivers will decide whether to ship RC1 as Firefox 4."_

The 22 March deadline could change if Mozilla spots an 11th hour show-stopping bug. Unlike **Internet Explorer 9** which is released two days back, Firefox will ship across multiple platforms, including Windows XP, going up against Microsoft and Google’s Chrome browser.
