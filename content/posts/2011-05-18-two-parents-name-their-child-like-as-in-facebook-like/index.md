Have you ever imagined a baby girl’s name as _“**Like”?**_  Well, its real now! More recently, a family in Israel decided to name their child “**Like**” after the Facebook button.

The social networking site Facebook provided the inspiration for the couple – Lior and Vardit Adler. She could be all cute and precious, but how idiotic is to name ‘**Like’?**

They explain it differently -

> _To me it is important to give my children names that are not used anywhere else, at least not in Israel. If once people gave Biblical names and that was the icon, then today this is one of the most famous icons in the world, he said, joking that the name could be seen as a modern version of the traditional Jewish name Ahuva, which means "beloved."_

> _I believe there will be people who will lift a eyebrow, but it is my girl and that's what's fun about it._

In future, some could just as well have been called ‘**Status’** or even ‘**Poke’**! How about ‘**dotcom’**, ‘**pie’..?** Do you have more names? Post in the comments section below.
