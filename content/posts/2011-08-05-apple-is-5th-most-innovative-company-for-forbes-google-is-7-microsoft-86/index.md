So, what is the measure for this Forbes [list](http://www.forbes.com/special-features/innovative-companies.html)?

Forbes calls it the five skills of disruptive innovators as below:

> _Questioning allows innovators to challenge the status quo and consider new possibilities._
> 
> _Observing helps innovators detect small details—in the activities of customers, suppliers and other companies—that suggest new ways of doing things._
> 
> _Networking permits innovators to gain radically different perspectives from individuals with diverse backgrounds._
> 
> _Experimenting prompts innovators to relentlessly try out new experiences, take things apart and test new ideas._
> 
> _Associational thinking—drawing connections among questions, problems or ideas from unrelated fields—is triggered by questioning, observing, networking and experimenting and is the catalyst for creative ideas._
