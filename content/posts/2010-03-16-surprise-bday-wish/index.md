After loads of Bday wishes from friends all over the globe over Phone, FB, Orkut, Twitter, Email...I just returned home and started checking mails on my E63.

One Email really surprised me! My CEO specially sent a Bday wish email :)

A big thanks to him and not to forget my boss who reminded the day. I never miss this special one!
