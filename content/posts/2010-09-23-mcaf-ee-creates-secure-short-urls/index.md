Antivirus Software company McAfee (_which recently_ [_acquired_](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/08/intel-to-acquire-mcafee-for-77-billion.html) _by Intel_) started new safe secure short URL service [Mcaf.ee](http://mcaf.ee/).

**So why are Mcaf.ee short URLs secure?** McAf.ee is powered by [McAfee Global Threat Intelligence](http://www.mcafee.com/us/mcafee_labs/gti.html), which lets you create short URLs which are checked against McAfee databases of known spam, dangerous, malware hosting, bot control sites prior to being shown.
