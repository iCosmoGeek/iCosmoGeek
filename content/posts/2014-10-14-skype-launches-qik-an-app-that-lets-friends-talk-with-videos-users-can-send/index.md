Skype launches Qik, an app that lets friends talk with videos.  
  
Users can send videos using the service to their friends, and their friends can reply back in a similar fashion. It’s a bit like Vine meets, well, just about any other messaging app.  
  
Available for free on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.
