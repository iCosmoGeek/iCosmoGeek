In a historic move, nearly 30 lakh cell phone subscribers have been disconnected from their respective networks across the country due to either incomplete or unverified customer details.

Few days back most of the users received calls from their respective cell phone operators and we thought that it is a usual procedure and many of the guys didn’t submit their details and all those unverified cell phone have been disconnected by the network operators.

The subscriber verification has become a major issue in the wake of security threat and use of cell phones by terrorists for carrying out their terror operations in India.
