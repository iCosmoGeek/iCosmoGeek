Surely, [Metro UI style](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/09/how-to-install-windows-8-on-virtual.html) in Windows 8 is real treat for PC users. Microsoft is currently building a number of innovative applications for Windows 8. Even though many of the apps are not currently available in Windows 8 Developer Preview, the software giant is expected to ship them in its Beta edition. These apps could be very similar to those of Windows Phone 7 devices.

While there could be a possibility that Microsoft may use its own VOIP based communication system using Windows Live, or Skype; there is a also a possibility that Microsoft could restrict this feature in only tablet based devices supporting phone capability feature. This phone feature could be a real bet if Microsoft takes directly to desktop PC users also.

Meanwhile, enjoy the powerful ‘People’ app features in Windows 8 that combines cloud based address book, Email accounts and lots more!

Do you have any ideas in building those all new Windows 8 Metro Style Apps?
