Microsoft today announced the launch of a new beta Facebook app from FUSE Labs called “Docs”, also available at  **docs.com**

Built on Microsoft Office 2010, the Docs app enables Facebook users for the first time to create and share Microsoft Office documents directly with their Facebook friends, using the Office tools they already know.

_**Discover. Create. Share.**_

_Now you can discover, create, and share Microsoft Office documents with your Facebook friends. Built using Microsoft Office 2010 – Docs for Facebook provides the best possible document service for the Facebook environment. Seamless integration with Facebook means that the service is all about sharing your documents. Finally docs can be friendly too!_

Incidentally, Microsoft has chosen to run Docs.com on the WordPress platform.
