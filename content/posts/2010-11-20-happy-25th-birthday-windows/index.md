Microsoft Windows completes 25 years today. **On November 20, 1985**, the first version **Windows 1.0** was released.

Can you recall how Windows 1.0 looked like? To be frank, I was born in the same year and no real hands-on experience for me until Windows 95! .

Oh, and of course **Windows 8.** I hardly know much about it at the moment except the [leaked](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-many-details.html) slides. Letâ€™s hope it is as well received as Windows 7 has been so far. **Happy Birthday Windows!**
