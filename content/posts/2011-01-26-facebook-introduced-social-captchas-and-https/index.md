Facebook is introducing two new measures to gripe up security – a secured connection and Social Authentication. These features are especially useful when you're uncertain whether your network or computer is secure.

**A Secured Connection –** Facebook currently uses HTTPS only when your password is sent, but today it is expanding its usage in order to help keep your data even more secure.You will now have the ability to experience Facebook entirely over HTTPS. You should consider enabling this option if you frequently use Facebook from public Internet access points found at coffee shops, airports, libraries or schools. You can enable this option under advanced security features from ‘Account Security’ section.

**Social Authentication –** This option is pretty clever. It will replace regular captchas (those slightly warped letters you are asked to re-enter to prove you are human) with a picture of one of your friends (_refer above picture_). You will need to identify the person to authenticate yourself when you are trying to retrieve a lost password or Facebook detects suspicious login activity on your account.

Hackers halfway across the world might know your password, but they don't know who your friends are! You do know what all your “friends” look like, don’t you? ![Smile with tongue out](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_40bmzDo_mBs/TUB2Y_zaR2I/AAAAAAAABvA/7x7rfP3GHd0/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800)
