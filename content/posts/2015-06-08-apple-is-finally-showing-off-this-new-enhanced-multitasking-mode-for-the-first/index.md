Apple is finally showing off this new, enhanced multitasking mode for the first time as part of its iOS 9 preview.  
  
Unfortunately, the big Split View simultaneous app mode is only going to work on the iPad Air 2 â€” SlideOver and picture-in-picture will be available on the iPad Air (from late 2013) and newer as well as all models of the iPad mini.
