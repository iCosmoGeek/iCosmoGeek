If you are new to the Android Phone market, Google just made the process of comparing devices a lot easier with the launch of their [Google Phone Gallery](http://www.google.com/phone). This new online database includes all the major Android manufactures along with most of the carriers that sell their phones

Android phones can be sorted by alphabetical order or release date. Users can even add up to three devices for a side-by-side comparison. Currently, only phones with Google Mobile Services are listed.
