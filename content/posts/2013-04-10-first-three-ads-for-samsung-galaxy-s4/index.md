Samsung has posted its first ads for the new Galaxy S 4 smartphone that will be available for pre-order next week. The ads show off a few of the phone's unique features like its built-in translator and multimedia sharing options.

AT&T will begin accepting pre-orders for this smartphone on April 16 starting at $199.99. For some reason, late last month when AT&T announced that it would accept pre-orders, it mentioned that pricing would be $249.99. We're still waiting for finalized pricing and release dates from the other carriers.
