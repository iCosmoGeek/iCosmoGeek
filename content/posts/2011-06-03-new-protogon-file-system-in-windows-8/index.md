IT World’s Sando Villinger has some interesting findings in Microsoft’s next generation operating system – **Windows 8**. One of the known or unknown hidden features that various people have discovered since internal builds began leaking over couple of months is the new file system – **Protogon.**

Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 features in a [press release](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/06/windows-8-comes-with-new-look-touch-and.html).

From the IT World article,

> _I’ve also dug up traces of some underlying file system changes that I couldn’t quite make sense of, such as an entirely new file system driver called “NT Protogon FS driver”, which looks like a kernel mode driver for some sort of (yet unknown) file system called Protogon. It’s unclear, whether this is a major new file system or just some minor subsystem_

We cannot say whether **Protogon** replaces **NTFS** file system currently but according to the available Disk Management findings, there is something related to new file system or it could be in early stages of development. Check out other hidden and interesting features in the IT World’s [post](http://www.itworld.com/software/169627/10-hidden-features-windows-8).

Windows 8 is expected to be released to manufacturing in early 2012.
