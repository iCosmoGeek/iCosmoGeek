Following a flop debut for its new smartphone, Amazon announced this morning that it is dropping the price of the Fire Phone from $200 to 99 cents with contract; from $649 to $449 w/o contract.  
  
The price cut comes a day before Apple is expected to debut its new iPhone lineup, creating additional competition for the Fire Phone.
