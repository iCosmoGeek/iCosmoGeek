Youâ€™ve still got email! But, from the people who led the first email revolution, **AOL** is redesigning its email service to a faster and easier interface called as Project **Phoenix.**

The Project Phoenix inbox page was designed to make it easier to fire off a quick e-mail, text or instant message with just a few clicks on a "**quick bar**" at the top of the page. People can also send short replies right from the inbox page, without having to click on a message first. The new design displays thumbnails of recent photo attachments at a glance, and lets people toggle between several open e-mails at a time.

It is now available only for a limited number of users. Starting next year, anyone will be able to sign up for access to a beta test site. Anyone interested can request invites from [here](http://feedback.aol.com/notify/phoenix)
