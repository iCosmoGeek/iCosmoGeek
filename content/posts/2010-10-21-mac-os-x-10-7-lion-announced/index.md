And now we’re bringing it all back to the Mac with our eighth major release of the world’s most advanced operating system. Mac OS X Lion arrives in summer 2011.

It has resulted in an expanded use of multitouch gestures (but not on a vertical screen), an emphasis on iPad-like full screen applications, and -- here's the big one -- an **[App Store for OS X](http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/)** (which will also be coming to Snow Leopard).

Other great features apart from **Mac App Store** include -

- **Launchpad –** A home for your apps
- **Full screen apps** - A better way to enjoy the apps you love.
- **Mission Control** – Mac command central
