According to TIME’s list, **Farmville** and **Foursquare** are among the world’s 50 worst inventions.

The list of “the world’s bright ideas that just didn’t work out” included both the location-based social game Foursquare and Zynga’s Farmville.

**Farmville** is the most addictive of Facebook games is hardly even a game — it's more a series of mindless chores on a digital farm, requiring the endless clicking of a mouse to plant and harvest crops. And yet Zynga, the evil genius behind this bizarre digital addiction, says more than 10% of Americans have logged in to create online homesteads.

_Recently, a 22-year-old mother (Alexandra V. Tobias) from Jacksonville, Florida, arrested for shaking her 3-month-old son to death after his crying interrupted her FarmVille game. She told the cops that she shook the baby, then smoked a cigarette for composing herself and again she proceeded to shake him again. She said his son would have hit his head during one of the two shakings._

When broadcasting your every thought via Facebook and Twitter isn't enough, there's **Foursquare**, the next generation of creepy social networking. Instead of saying where you are, you can use your phone's GPS to broadcast the address. Just another tool tapping into a generation of narcissism, with which you can earn badges for checking into your local Starbucks more than anyone else.
