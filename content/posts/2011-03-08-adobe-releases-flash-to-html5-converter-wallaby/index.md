To compete the HTML5 competence, Adobe released a new experimental **Flash to HTML5** conversion tool (codenamed **Wallaby**)yesterday night.

"**Wallaby**" is the codename for an experimental technology that converts the artwork and animation contained in Adobe® Flash® Professional (FLA) files into HTML. Its just a matter of dragging and dropping thing to convert flash files into HTML5. The company is specifically hoping this tool will make it easier for designers and developers to get their content onto iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad.

Once these files are converted to HTML, you can edit them with an HTML editing tool, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, or by hand if desired. You can view the output in one of the supported browsers or on an iOS device.

Adobe feels there’s still room in the current technological and creative spaces for Flash, but it doesn’t think that either Flash or HTML5 has to exist to the exclusion of the other.

Wallaby is not a final product and is still in the testing and validation phase. Test it from the Adobe labs page [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/ "http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/")
