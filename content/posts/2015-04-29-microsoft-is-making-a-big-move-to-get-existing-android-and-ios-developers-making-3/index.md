Microsoft is making a big move to get existing Android and iOS developers making Windows apps. Existing code can be reused to easily build software for Microsoft-powered devices.  
  
Speaking at the companyâ€™s Build conference, Microsoft operating systems chief Terry Myerson announced that Windows Phones will include an Android subsystem that lets developers reuse all of the Java and C++ code from an Android phone app to create apps for phones running Windows 10. 
  
In addition, Myerson announced that developers will be able to compile Objective C code from Apple iOS apps inside Visual Studio on Windows, allowing them to leverage that code to create Windows apps.
