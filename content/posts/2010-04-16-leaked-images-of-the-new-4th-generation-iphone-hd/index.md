Folks over at [MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/04/15/questionable-next-generation-iphone-rear-shell-images-surface/) have been tipped with images of what appears to be the the 4th Generation iPhone HD. Interestingly! the images reveal that there is no LED Flash on the back which puts us in a little doubt since [our sources believe](http://www.sizlopedia.com/2010/04/09/led-flash-confirmed-new-iphone-hd/) that it is bound to make an appearance on the new iPhone.

There has been quite some amount of speculation as to whether Apple might have plans to bring the aluminum unibody enclosure, as seen on the Macbook and iPad, to the iPhone but there has been no official confirmation on the matter.
