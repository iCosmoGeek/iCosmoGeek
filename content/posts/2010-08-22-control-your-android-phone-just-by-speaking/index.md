Now you can control your Android phone just by speaking using ‘Voice Actions’. This feature is unveiled at a press event at its San Francisco office in spite of rumors on [Video Calling](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/08/will-google-reveal-video-calling-at.html).

You require Android 2.2 (Froyo) and higher for these features -
