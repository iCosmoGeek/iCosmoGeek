If you have your personal [Page](http://www.facebook.com/cosmoGeek) in Facebook, you know that you are allowed to promote that page to your friends, through only recommendations. Recommendations are not that great in which your friend might miss it as it only triggers email and the actual button resides in a corner of the Facebook sidebar.

Today, Facebook introduced new way to recommend your fan page to your friends so that theyâ€™ll appear as notifications and also email message depending on the user settings.
