[Girish Kundlani](http://twitter.com/girishku) speaks about Windows Azure and its benefits in an exclusive interview with MSDN blog team as a part of their ‘Real World Windows Azure’ series.

_**Windows Azure** is the real cloud computing platform that allows Microsoft datacenters to host and run applications. Rather than providing software that customers can install and run themselves on their own computers, Windows Azure today is a service: Customers use it to run applications and store data on Internet-accessible machines owned by Microsoft._

Girsh Kundlani discussed briefly about the benefits of using Windows Azure platform for the [company’s](http://www.maqsoftware.com/) enterprise resource management applications.

> **MSDN: What makes MAQ Software unique?** **Kundlani:** Unlike other companies that typically depend on local setup for location-based intranet solutions, we deployed ours to the cloud and can ensure that one solution is available across all of our dispersed locations.
> 
> **MSDN: What kinds of benefits are you realizing with the Windows Azure platform?** **Kundlani:** We now have solutions that aren't limited by a physical infrastructure and offer us the scalability that we need for continued growth. We don't have to buy servers to deploy; we can take advantage of Windows Azure and Microsoft data centers to add more computing resources for improved performance and more storage as our capacity needs increase-plus, with 99.99 percent up-time, we have the high availability we need. We have also reduced our hosting costs from up to U.S.$400 per application to only $66 per application each month and, at the same time, were able to bring our applications to market quickly.
