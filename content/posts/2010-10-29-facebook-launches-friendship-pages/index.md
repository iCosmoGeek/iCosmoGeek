Facebook is now allowing you to document all of your interactions on the network with particular friends on designated pages called ‘**[Friendship Pages](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=443390892130)**,’ the pages contain all public Wall posts and comments between you and a designated friend, photos in which you are both are tagged, events you’ve RSVP’d to together and more.

You’ll be able to see other’s friendship page if you are friends with one of the people and have permission to view both people’s profiles.

Well, If you don't like it, the standard Facebook disclaimer applies: Don't put anything on the site that you wouldn't be comfortable sharing with everyone, and take control of your privacy settings, or just don't use the site at all![Smile](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_40bmzDo_mBs/TMsRjGCnk0I/AAAAAAAABfU/SbrrMlBJtMM/wlEmoticon-smile%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800)
