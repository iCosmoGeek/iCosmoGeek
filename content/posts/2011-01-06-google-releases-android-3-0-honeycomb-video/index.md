Google has released an official video on their YouTube channel, unleashing **Android 3.0** – designed _exclusively for tablets_. It’s been pretty much confirmed that 3.0 is **Honeycomb**.

If the video embedded below is anything to go by, the next-generation of Android tablets could pose the first real challenge to Apple iPad (or iPad 2), unlike the current-gen Android tablets like Samsung’s Galaxy Tab.

This “Entirely for Tablet” version of Android, in the quick glimpse, we can see that Android, at least at the face value we can see here, has been given a pretty big advancement in the User Interface (UI).

Android 3.0, or Honeycomb, is rumoured to launch in March of this year.
