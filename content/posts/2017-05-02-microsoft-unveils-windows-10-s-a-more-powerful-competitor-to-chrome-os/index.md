At its event in New York today, Microsoft announced a new iteration of Windows 10: Windows 10 S - Microsoft challenger to Chrome OS. Microsoft is calling it a “streamlined” version of Windows 10, optimized to run on lower end hardware. The OS is limited to only run apps from the Window Store, but they can still be full Win32 apps – they simply have to be available from the store.
