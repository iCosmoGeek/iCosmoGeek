Ever wish you could have answers and direct access to websites before you complete a query, hit the search button, or go to a search results page? Yes, we do have Google Instant search already!

Yesterday, Yahoo CTO Blake introduced Yahoo’s version of [**Google Instant**](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/09/after-google-instant-its-youtube.html)**,** “Search Direct” at a press event.

The simple way to describe it is as Yahoo’s version of Google’s Instant Search but with richer content. Blake reminds the audience that Yahoo developed a version of Instant Search years before Google (though Google Instant isn’t named). He argues that this is “much richer, much faster”.

Search Direct predicts search results as fast as a person types, character by character, and presents those results dynamically, generating a fast, simple search experience that goes beyond a list of blue links.
