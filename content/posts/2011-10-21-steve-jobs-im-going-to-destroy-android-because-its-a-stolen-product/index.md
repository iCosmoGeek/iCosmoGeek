With the release date of official Steve Jobs’ [biography](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/06/steve-jobs-official-biography-tops-best.html) fast approaching (Monday, October 24), [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/20/scitech/main20123421.shtml?tag=cbsnewsSectionContent.10) managed to pull some interesting quotes from it. According to the report, Jobs felt that Google’s Android OS frayed off a number of features from Apple’s iPhone and iOS.

Interesting passages from the book include Jobs’ anger towards Google and Eric Schmidt after HTC released iPhone like device running Android. Jobs went as far as to consider Google’s actions "grand theft," and so began the string of lawsuits which have now drawn a very prominent wedge between the two rivals.

> **_“I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,” Jobs said. “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.”_**

  
Jobs would later meet with Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt to discuss settling the lawsuit. That meeting, according to the book, did not go well.

> **_”I don’t want your money, If you offer me $5 billion, I won’t want it. I’ve got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that’s all I want.”_**
