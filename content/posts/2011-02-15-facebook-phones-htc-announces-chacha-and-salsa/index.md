Mark Zuckerberg said it before: there will be no [Facebook phone](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/09/facebook-we-are-not-building-phone.html). And now its clear what he meant – his strategy is to integrate Facebook into every phone telling us today at the HTC launch event in Barcelona.

  

He also gave a sign with expectation of dozens of Facebook phones featuring deep social integration coming this year.
