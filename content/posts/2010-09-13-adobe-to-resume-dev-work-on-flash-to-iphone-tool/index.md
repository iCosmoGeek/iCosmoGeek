Responding to Apple's announcement that it is easing a number of restrictions on App Store app development including the use of third-party development tools, Adobe has indicated  that it will resume work on its Packager for iPhone tool in Flash Professional CS5 that allows developers to export their Flash projects in native iOS format.

Here is the relevant blog post from [Adobe](http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/09/great-news-for-developers.html):

> _“Apple’s announcement today that it has lifted restrictions on its third-party developer guidelines has direct implications for Adobe’s Packager for iPhone, a feature in the Flash Professional CS5 authoring tool. This feature was created to enable Flash developers to quickly and easily deliver applications for iOS devices. The feature is available for developers to use today in Flash Professional CS5, and we will now resume development work on this feature for future releases.”_
