Consumers will likely see 3D LCD TVs that don't require people to wear polarised glasses out on global markets by 2015, according to a Taiwanese research group that showed off an early version of such a device this week.

Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) displayed a 42-inch glasses-free 3D LCD TV this week, and the company can currently make them with screens as large as 65 inches, according to Stephen Jeng, director of ITRI's 3D System & Application Division.

The technology is considered vital to getting 3D into more people's living rooms. Analysts say most people don't want to wear polarised glasses to watch 3D TV, and many balk at the price, up to $200 per pair for some of the glasses. The high price might make a person think twice about hosting a World Cup or Super Bowl party with friends.

A number of companies are working on glasses-free 3D TVs, mainly in Japan and South Korea.

The 3D TV concept took off early this year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as most major TV makers, including Samsung Electronics, showed off sets that are 3D-capable, meaning people can use them as regular high definition (2-dimensional) TVs or as 3D TVs.
