**Windows 7** has been a powerful success for Microsoft. As an evolutionary upgrade to Vista, it patched almost all of Vista’s glaring holes: broken driver support, sluggish performance and the horribly annoying User-Account Control. It sold more than 240 million licenses in one year.

Asked about the riskiest product bet the Redmond crew is currently developing, the answer is not Windows Phone 7 or Bing or even Office Web Apps - its fearless leader **Steve Ballmer** took no time in answering **"the next release of Windows."**

Windows 8 is expected to be another revolutionary release to the Windows product line. Windows 8 plans already [leaked](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-many-details.html) to the web  - Facial recognition, True-Instant On, Windows Store, and more – all evolutionary, nothing revolutionary.

Revolutionary would be an entirely new booting system / kernel, an all new registry design and an all-new interface design that takes Microsoft _right_ back to the drawing board – starting from scratch a la Windows Phone 7.

Watch **Steve Ballmer** at the [Gartner](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/ballmer-riskiest-product-bet-by-microsoft-is-the-next-release-of-windows/7786) Symposium in the video embedded below :

So why did Ballmer characterize Windows 8 as “risky”? Guesses? Ideas? Crazy (or not so crazy) theories?
