Success breeds imitation and we have the next Galaxy S remake to bear witness. But make no mistake about it – the **Samsung I9003 Galaxy SL** is not just another clone. Samsung has phased out the super successful **I9000 Galaxy S** and launched an updated version in India for just under Rs 20000.

Although its actually hard to notice a difference on the outside, this new device has got a new screen, a new CPU and a different battery.

> The Galaxy SL comes with **Super LCD** 4.0-inch 800 x 480 Touchscreen display instead of **Super AMOLED** screen found on the Galaxy S. Super Clear LCD is somewhat inferior to SuperAMOLED.
> 
> The Galaxy SL  has a weaker **PowerVR** **SGX530 GPU** as compared to that of Galaxy S which comes with **PowerVR SGX540 GPU.**
> 
> Battery life of updated version is better which now comes with 1650mAh battery compared to 1500mAh battery on the Galaxy S.

Other features include 5 MP autofocus camera with face, smile and blink detection; 720p HD video recording at 30fps; Android 2.2 OS.

I find the Android 2.2 device extremely value for money in Indian market and think would give a tough competition to recently launched **Motorola Defy** in the same price range.

If you are eager enough, pre-order this device from **[Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com/samsung-galaxy-s-lcd-i9003-mobile-mobcvwavyvzuyh5c)**.
