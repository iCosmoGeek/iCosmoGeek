Google today introduced  a new feature **Google +1** which allows to share recommendations with the world right in Google’s search results. It is yet another attempt to make search more social.

This feature is slowly rolled out to Google.com, but you can try it by enabling the [+1 search experiment](http://www.google.com/experimental/index.html).
