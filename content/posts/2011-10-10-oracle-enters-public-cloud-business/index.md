This Oracle cloud is complete with an Oracle Database service, a Java PaaS service, Fusion HCM and CRM apps, and even a social network. The Oracle Public Cloud service is a monthly subscription service versus pay-as-you-go from its rivals. This service can put direct competition with other cloud offerings including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, the Rackspace Cloud Computing service, and Salesforce.comâ€™s Force.com service.
