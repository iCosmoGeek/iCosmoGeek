Can you search and **find the ANY key** on your keyboard? My friend was prompted by the computer to **“Press ANY key to continue”** and he could not locate the ANY key!

Professional tech support can help you find ANY key

In case you still did not get it, there is **no ANY key on the computer keyboard**. It basically means you can press any key on the keyboard – a,b,c,d,e, 4, F1, SPACE… and the computer program will continue. That’s it. Ha…Ha..
