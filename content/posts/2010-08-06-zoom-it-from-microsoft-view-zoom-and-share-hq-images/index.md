Zoom.it is a free service for viewing and sharing high-resolution imagery. Give a link to any image and it will give you a beautiful new way to experience it - along with a nice short URL.

Zoom.it converts your image to the  Deep Zoom format, which lets you smoothly and efficiently explore the whole image, no matter how large. Zoom.it runs on  Windows Azure and takes advantage of  Microsoft Silverlight to provide the richest, most fluid zooming experience possible.

Zoom.it was created by Microsoft Live Labs, the same folks who brought you Photosynth and Pivot.
