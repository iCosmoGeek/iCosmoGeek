After President Trump's demand to sell TikTok to an American firm began, every major company competed for the 100m users firm. Microsoft seemed ahead with the race, but Oracle's Trump card brokered the deal!

The most obvious winner in all this is China's government. ByteDance gets to keep its prize asset rather than sell it on the cheap. Their government played the political chess game to perfection. Oracle will probably only benefit if it manages to convince TikTok's cloud contract from Google to its cloud platform.
