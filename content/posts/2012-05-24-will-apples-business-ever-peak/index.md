It's logical to think that at some point, Apple will not be able to gain any more customers, once every person in the world eats at the table of the iProduct. However, they seem to be performing well enough at the moment - that we can be certain of.

The thing about Apple products is that, like them or hate them, chances are that at some point you might own one simply because Apple is cornering the market in a lot of ways. Their build quality isn't to be sniffed at, even by those who consider their pricing something aimed more at a Party CasinoÂ champion than the average Joe, and their efforts as far as innovation is concerned are second to none.

They're also benefiting from what could be seen as the effect of simply being original. Many of the latest Ultrabooks take at least one design inspiration from the Macbook Air series, which may make potential consumers of the inspired-design devices wonder why they're not going with the original model, even if they plan to ensure that Windows replaces Apple's OSX operating system soon after purchase.

But there will come a point where Apple will want to gain a larger market share than it does already by a significant amount, and at this point they may need to consider starting to lower their prices. At the moment, their profit percentages per iDevice are in the three digits, and the company sees sales figures that most technology companies can only dream of. This may be ideal for Apple, but their pricing strategy places a wall of financial requirement between the company, and its many potential consumers.

Apple's business can only really peak if it continues to make its products more accessible, such as the reasonable pricing of Apple TV boxes. Whether they'll soon offer iOxygen and iFood is unclear, but it's a safe bet that everything being Apple isn't a completely ridiculous notion.
