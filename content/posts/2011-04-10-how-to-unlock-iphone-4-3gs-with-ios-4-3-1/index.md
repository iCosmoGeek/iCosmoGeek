As expected earlier [today](https://twitter.com/#!/k_avinash/status/56836221271412736), the Dev team released an unlock for **iPhone 4, 3GS** devices running **01.59.00, 04.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, and 06.15.00** basebands.

If your baseband is different from any of these, there is no unlock available at this time.

Its already [confirmed](http://www.cosmogeek.info/2011/01/no-more-ios-updates-unlocks-jailbreaks.html) in the past that there will be no iOS updates, unlocks, jailbreaks for iPhone 3G and iPod touch 2G models.

**Tutorial for iPhone 4 Windows users only:**

Lets break the tutorial into three parts – **Preserve baseband, Jailbreak, Unlock**

**\[PART 1\]**

**Step 1:** First, you will have to jailbreak your device using **TinyUmbrella** on **iOS 4.3.1** and preserve the baseband mentioned above \[Settings > General > About  > Modem Firmware\].

**Step 2:** Download TinyUmbrella from [here](http://cache.firmwareumbrella.com/downloads/tinyumbrella-4.30.05.exe) \[v4.30.05, 1.7MB\]

**Step 3:** Connect your iPhone 4 and launch TinyUmbrella. Click ‘**Save SHSH’** button (_make sure SHSH were saved, if not don't bother continuing_)

**Step 4:** Click ‘**TSS Server’** button (_If you get errors, consult Google to fix it instantly, typically it fails because you have some kind of web sharing enabled. Use the comments section for delayed help_)

**Step 5:** While TSS server running, launch **iTunes**

**Step 6:** Now, in iTunes, click **Restore**. Do not click **Update**.

**Step 7:** During the restoration process, iTunes should give error code 1013. Nothing to worry. This error means your baseband has been preserved. Now, exit iTunes

**Step 8:** Now, turn your iPhone into **DFU mode** _(Hold Power button and Home button for 10s, release the Power button, and continue holding Home button for another 5s. If your timing is even a little bit off, you will see the Apple logo and your phone will boot back into recovery mode. Go back to step 8 and try again!)_

**Step 9:** In the DFU mode, click ‘**Fix Recovery’** and ‘**Yes**’ to proceed further.

**Step 10:** Your device's screen will turn white and you'll see debug boot information. Your iPhone 4 will now be on 4.3.1 with the preserved baseband.

**\[PART 2\]**

**Step 11:** Now, to **jailbreak** your iPhone 4 on iOS 4.3.1, download **RedSn0w** from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.6rc12.zip?attredirects=0&d=1) \[v0.9.6rc12\]

**Step 12:** Download **iPhone 4 firmware 4.3.1** from Apple [here](http://appldnld.apple.com/iPhone4/041-0551.20110325.Aw2Dr/iPhone3,1_4.3.1_8G4_Restore.ipsw) \[3GS firmware location [here](http://appldnld.apple.com/iPhone4/041-0549.20110325.ZxP8u/iPhone2,1_4.3.1_8G4_Restore.ipsw)\]

**Step 13:** Launch **RedSn0w** and select the firmware you downloaded in the above step.

**Step 14:** While RedSn0w prepares to jailbreak, in the next step, choose ‘**Install Cydia’** and click next

**Step 15:** Follow the on screen instructions to enter into **DFU mode**, once completed, you should see a **pineapple**!

**Step 16:** Your iPhone will reboot by itself and you should now have a jail broken iPhone with Cydia installed.

**\[PART 3\]**

**Step 17:** Once booted into the device, launch **Cydia**, then go to Manage > Sources > Edit > Add,  and type in the following: [**http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com**](http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com) and touch **‘Add Source’**

**Step 18:** Cydia will now automatically update your sources by following a series of automated steps. After this is completed, search for **ultrasn0w 1.2.1** in Cydia and install this app. This app will **automatically unlock** your iPhone so that you can use it with any carrier.

**Step 19:** Finally, restart your device and you should have a fully unlocked iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.1.
