Have you ever imagined of viewing 3D images on your iPhone 4 without glasses?

Jeremie Francone and Laurence Nigay, two researchers from the **Laboratory of Informatics of Grenoble** at the EHCI Research Group in France, have created an unbelievable technology for viewing 3D images on iOS devices without glasses.

**i3D (Free App)** which is developed by the [University Joseph Fourier](http://iihm.imag.fr/francone/i3D/) uses **Head-Coupled Perspective (HCP)** which uses the front camera of the device to track the face of the user in real time. This information tells the app how the user is looking at the display. The app updates the perspective of the 3D scene accordingly, giving the user the illusion that he looks at a small window. The objects on the screen will change their position creating a 3D like effect on a 2D screen.

Watch this demo video to experience it virtually!

This app runs on iPhone 4, iPad 2, iPod touch (4th generation) as it requires front facing camera. We can expect this technology soon in next generation apps including apps in near future. There is no other practical app that makes use of this technology as of yet.
