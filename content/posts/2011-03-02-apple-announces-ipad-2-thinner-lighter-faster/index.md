The wait is over. Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who is taking a leave absence from the company, returned to unveil the new product **iPad 2** at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco today. As rumored, the next generation tablet device will have a 33% thinner profile.

Other awesome features you can play on this new iPad 2 include

> **Photo Booth  -** you can manipulate effects by touching.
> 
> You can **FaceTime** between two iPads, between an iPad and an iPhone, or between an iPad and a Mac.
> 
> **iMovie** for iPad. Precision editor, Multi-track audio recording, new themes. HD video sharing.
> 
> **GarageBand** Touch instruments, you can plug in a guitar if you want, but it's got touch instruments. Guitar amps and effects, 8 track recording and mixing, 250+ loops

_Finally, Steve says “This is worth repeating. It's in Apple's DNA that technology is not enough. It's tech married with the liberal arts and the humanities. Nowhere is that more true than in the post-PC products. Our competitors are looking at this like it's the next PC market. That is not the right approach to this. These are pos-PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC, more intuitive.”_

**I think 2011 is clearly the year of iPad 2.**
